000-044-406-877-596,Impact of biochar field aging on laboratory greenhouse gas production potentials.,2012-10-05,2012,journal article,GCB Bioenergy,17571693; 17571707,Wiley,Germany,Kurt A. Spokas,"Recent observations of decreased greenhouse gas (GHG) production from biochar amended soils have been used to further substantiate the environmental benefit of biochar production and soil incorporation strategies. However, the mechanisms behind this biochar-mediated response have not been fully elucidated. In addition, the duration of these GHG reductions is not known and is of pivotal importance for the inclusion of biochar into future bioenergy production and climate abatement strategies. In this study, the impacts of biochar field aging on the observed GHG production/consumption were evaluated. Two different wood-derived biochars and a macadamia nut shell biochar were weathered in an agricultural field in Rosemount, MN (2008–2011) and the impacts on net soil GHG production/consumption were assessed through laboratory incubations. For the three biochars evaluated here, weathering negated the suppression of N2O production that was originally observed from the fresh biochar in laboratory incubations. On the other hand, all three weathered biochars enhanced CO2 production (three- to tenfold compared with the fresh biochar amendments) in laboratory soil incubations, suggesting an enhanced microbial mineralization rate of the weathered biochar. This enhanced mineralization could be aided by the chemical oxidation of the biochar surfaces during weathering. Fresh biochar reduced observed soil methane oxidation rates, whereas the weathered biochars had no significant impacts on the observed soil methanotrophic activity. This study demonstrates that for these three biochars, weathering greatly alters the GHG response of the soil systems to biochar amendments.",5,2,165,176,Environmental chemistry; Mineralization (soil science); Soil classification; Soil water; Soil conditioner; Slash-and-char; Carbon sequestration; Macadamia nut; Environmental science; Biochar; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20133092616 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12005/full https://ars.usda.gov/sp2userfiles/person/41695/reprints/gcbb12005.pdf https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=57338&content=PDF https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12005 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20133092616.html https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcbb.12005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12005,,10.1111/gcbb.12005,2153997867,,0,000-056-277-157-530; 001-020-299-979-027; 001-054-164-261-355; 001-236-614-798-676; 001-298-202-769-979; 001-906-397-779-267; 002-176-140-520-190; 004-457-296-040-066; 004-901-144-299-763; 005-497-158-462-167; 008-231-292-607-196; 009-605-278-191-067; 009-668-843-267-975; 010-115-782-611-378; 011-298-420-957-938; 012-790-206-813-539; 012-990-554-436-799; 013-049-651-724-088; 013-550-648-417-393; 017-309-794-062-695; 017-472-433-479-911; 018-720-212-720-149; 019-330-245-299-146; 020-037-123-018-636; 022-445-339-768-677; 023-341-514-331-465; 025-598-188-004-413; 025-920-112-008-277; 026-187-815-318-981; 026-615-422-288-361; 028-036-289-052-849; 030-085-678-415-511; 030-382-287-804-107; 031-150-139-247-357; 031-645-982-389-396; 031-944-367-760-878; 032-248-777-496-085; 033-360-762-101-227; 034-010-237-534-469; 034-676-828-109-852; 035-368-118-608-608; 035-456-554-475-290; 039-161-723-985-820; 039-775-040-456-520; 039-951-968-979-329; 042-920-601-253-392; 043-085-705-071-171; 043-781-100-209-077; 046-936-522-334-030; 047-245-784-808-199; 047-322-274-693-519; 049-770-657-481-187; 050-483-112-498-249; 051-737-250-166-385; 052-050-695-096-354; 054-760-785-399-913; 055-093-547-322-662; 061-046-681-496-618; 061-728-097-587-658; 062-710-603-262-639; 064-343-637-702-285; 065-281-086-727-480; 068-755-427-982-609; 068-781-169-459-602; 069-387-239-627-028; 071-480-400-593-951; 076-941-259-729-047; 080-251-935-004-559; 081-300-711-676-983; 081-358-596-966-61X; 081-965-203-455-443; 082-831-201-782-021; 085-560-907-942-995; 086-583-548-959-362; 088-318-606-762-978; 093-492-627-156-672; 095-240-243-160-930; 096-514-510-325-915; 097-724-935-616-330; 098-992-829-065-712; 099-101-159-626-932; 101-765-041-868-372; 102-819-232-224-630; 103-660-368-099-765; 106-693-719-816-704; 106-706-093-984-30X; 107-700-538-900-332; 109-083-579-367-142; 109-694-046-310-381; 116-256-308-468-255; 116-739-747-398-275; 118-393-425-860-292; 123-125-385-542-547; 125-766-922-988-230; 133-588-704-054-481; 134-701-699-282-663; 140-076-878-272-862; 142-133-599-394-235; 148-237-886-102-500; 152-508-000-871-850; 157-458-799-934-021; 158-110-847-276-668; 163-693-684-972-092; 166-375-251-063-673; 171-810-975-061-440; 174-685-171-957-400; 178-340-595-036-025; 184-462-136-906-231; 184-644-273-934-324,170

This paper reports the impacts of pyrolysis parameters on biochar characteristics. A preliminary examination of the scientific literature revealed that the type of feedstock, the temperature, the heating rate and the gas flow were the major parameters influencing the biochar characteristics. This review highlights the multitude of biochars that can be made and shows the importance of characterizing them before their use in soils. Then we assess how the input of biochars in soils can affect soil parameters. A review of the literature showed modifications on: i) the physical properties of soils (i.e. the modification in soil structure and water retention), ii) the chemical properties of soils (i.e. the modification of pH, cation exchange capacity, nutrient availability, the organic matter content) and iii) the biological properties (i.e. the changes in microbial and faunal communities). All these modifications can lead to an increase in crop productivity, which confirms the value of biochars as a soil amendment. Moreover, biochars can also provide an advantage for soil remediation. Indeed, biochars efficiently reduce the bioavailability of organic and inorganic pollutants. In addition, this review focuses on a specific plant that can be used to produce biochars: Miscanthus, a non-wood rhizomatous C4 perennial grass. Miscanthus presents advantages for biochar production due to: i) its lignocellulosic content, ii) its silicon content, which can mitigate environmental stresses (notably for plants grown on contaminated sites) and iii) the greater surface area of the Miscanthus biochars compared to the biochars produced with other feedstock.",162,,275,289,Environmental chemistry; Soil conditioner; Soil organic matter; Cation-exchange capacity; Soil pH; Miscanthus; Biomass; Environmental pollution; Environmental science; Waste management; Biochar,Biochar; Metallic and organic pollutants; Miscanthus; Soil management,"Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Carbon/analysis; Charcoal/chemistry; Environmental Pollution; Lignin/chemistry; Poaceae/chemistry; Silicon/chemistry; Soil Pollutants/chemistry; Temperature",Soil Pollutants; biochar; lignocellulose; Charcoal; Carbon; Lignin; Silicon,Nord-Pas de Calais Council; Bpifrance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26265597/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479715301997 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Acris.maastrichtuniversity.nl%3Apublications%2F55b34073-e6a2-44e9-b91a-8474d5433f2a https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/elaboration-characteristics-and-advantages-of-biochars-for-the-ma https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479715301997 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153340890 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20153340890.html https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26265597 https://core.ac.uk/display/90681135 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26265597,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.07.056,26265597,10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.07.056,1075420980,,0,000-851-235-070-915; 002-375-363-123-688; 002-845-740-872-339; 004-331-505-940-199; 004-457-296-040-066; 004-470-849-482-996; 004-992-278-762-190; 005-301-058-671-626; 007-611-302-125-536; 007-836-056-842-093; 007-857-594-112-306; 008-068-320-957-947; 008-545-655-691-895; 008-736-712-141-147; 010-344-115-563-383; 010-531-942-576-755; 011-251-759-025-795; 011-298-420-957-938; 011-841-425-938-121; 011-976-968-066-874; 012-042-610-515-150; 013-019-996-884-311; 013-550-648-417-393; 014-026-509-704-03X; 014-931-517-175-14X; 015-640-704-393-739; 015-818-626-255-909; 016-164-478-595-085; 019-064-680-775-70X; 020-084-884-037-251; 021-155-526-760-214; 021-705-104-175-086; 022-522-674-932-194; 022-689-336-468-725; 022-710-227-296-251; 023-340-481-599-937; 023-820-889-770-497; 024-349-006-488-901; 024-362-112-781-665; 024-387-946-516-957; 025-211-927-087-015; 025-507-805-504-565; 025-688-132-389-499; 025-867-953-331-327; 026-825-769-251-643; 027-505-322-101-941; 027-717-039-104-367; 028-106-051-277-66X; 028-656-050-935-057; 028-897-047-783-459; 030-860-838-294-080; 031-136-255-381-114; 031-218-903-265-20X; 031-528-662-129-509; 031-619-430-678-06X; 032-212-533-477-158; 032-480-422-463-838; 032-850-004-720-083; 033-050-379-812-655; 033-829-663-086-442; 034-099-307-816-300; 035-368-118-608-608; 037-694-577-000-032; 038-605-731-338-461; 038-922-685-419-306; 041-139-503-416-264; 042-246-892-000-341; 042-296-203-785-127; 043-538-037-923-031; 043-823-274-826-393; 044-255-366-796-578; 044-942-531-742-755; 045-312-617-711-247; 046-388-857-753-005; 047-421-857-806-945; 049-551-430-144-24X; 049-851-176-453-905; 051-735-902-040-333; 053-172-789-818-049; 054-203-878-086-260; 055-340-839-717-08X; 056-861-562-617-472; 059-681-407-612-410; 060-261-544-138-916; 060-903-058-804-719; 062-261-509-313-056; 062-583-733-253-715; 063-988-851-384-806; 065-281-086-727-480; 067-765-259-656-339; 068-322-055-635-572; 069-026-734-505-307; 070-601-258-831-251; 072-442-571-851-950; 072-644-808-450-860; 074-146-483-036-338; 074-820-124-008-636; 074-918-559-091-155; 076-410-396-589-172; 076-733-394-119-843; 077-370-489-200-050; 078-845-858-177-566; 079-302-534-735-897; 079-775-032-728-54X; 080-928-708-288-266; 081-045-767-293-652; 081-522-659-782-570; 083-037-024-633-233; 083-116-756-288-717; 085-063-482-102-108; 085-560-907-942-995; 085-687-474-414-342; 086-718-493-763-148; 087-798-390-952-818; 087-844-281-508-886; 088-844-672-920-41X; 089-988-589-172-552; 093-458-317-147-771; 096-753-433-039-357; 098-215-196-867-849; 098-863-310-637-402; 100-709-061-623-425; 101-072-952-588-484; 102-819-232-224-630; 103-898-197-240-33X; 106-509-943-339-84X; 107-776-002-055-231; 110-088-682-392-483; 111-468-290-239-552; 112-497-974-413-936; 112-850-752-099-157; 114-883-435-477-453; 117-345-188-645-317; 119-431-867-992-410; 119-618-930-427-706; 122-010-176-685-684; 123-125-385-542-547; 133-861-873-489-093; 144-108-180-046-774; 149-674-512-002-398; 157-458-799-934-021; 169-325-627-121-557; 173-407-668-928-983; 175-117-506-616-458; 178-728-592-310-480; 180-933-688-320-792; 181-150-342-777-512; 184-261-773-220-661; 184-553-412-330-253; 189-523-715-245-536,56

Ebhin Masto; Ashok K. Singh; Pradeep K. Singh,"Amelioration of mine soil is challenging because of the lack of biologically active organic matter. The study was aimed to recycle yard waste into compost and biochar and to use them to reclaim mine soil. Biochar prepared at 350 °C showed the highest stable organic matter yield index and was used for the experiments. Lady’s finger was grown on mine soil amended with biochar (1%–5%), compost (2%–10%), and biochar-compost mixtures (2%–10%). Mine soil pH increased in all treatments. Mine soil dehydrogenase activity (42%–224%), microbial biomass carbon (4%–257%), and hydrolase activity (3%–230%) increased by combined application of biochar and compost. Lady’s finger plant height, biomass, and fruit yield were superior in biochar–compost mixtures compared to biochar and compost alone treatment. Thus the use of compost along with biochar could be recommended for reclamation of mine soil.",108,3,1,7,Soil pH; Soil quality; Biomass; Abelmoschus; Compost; Environmental science; Organic matter; Biochar; Land reclamation; Agronomy,Abelmoschus esculentus; Biochar; Compost; Microbial biomass; Mine soil,Abelmoschus; Charcoal; Composting; Humans; Soil; Soil Pollutants/analysis,Soil; Soil Pollutants; biochar; Charcoal,"Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (Scientist Pool Scheme (Pool No. 8888/A))",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00128-020-03011-8 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33025110,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-020-03011-8,33025110,10.1007/s00128-020-03011-8,3092155114,,0,004-673-631-139-95X; 010-598-342-847-028; 012-091-303-477-802; 022-104-504-693-918; 022-189-252-820-460; 025-165-622-758-16X; 026-915-707-994-627; 031-600-118-384-382; 033-816-732-969-941; 035-419-277-484-259; 036-012-455-475-577; 036-579-514-261-26X; 037-745-479-733-141; 038-110-124-115-392; 042-987-500-793-556; 044-020-669-697-693; 046-572-817-133-83X; 048-961-983-264-255; 049-835-525-808-613; 050-283-970-283-379; 059-003-128-993-115; 083-937-733-878-43X; 101-909-691-699-97X; 107-071-340-378-64X; 111-841-111-523-834; 117-126-875-331-205; 129-273-021-461-247; 138-940-336-086-157; 154-911-856-941-206; 171-829-519-551-008; 175-271-218-619-73X; 188-341-253-405-043,3

However, the effect of aged biochar on ARGs abundance in soil and ARGs enrichment in plants are scarcely investigated. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to compare the effects of fresh and aged biochars on the accumulation of five typical ARGs including tetX, tetW, sul2, ermB, and intI1 in a chicken manure-fertilized soil and in pakchoi (Brassica chinensis L.). Results showed that both biochars significantly decreased the abundance of tetW, sul2, and ermB and increased the abundance of tetX and intI1 in soil. However, the accumulation of all tested ARGs in pakchoi were significantly decreased by both biochars. At the lower addition rate (1%), the fresh biochar was superior to the aged biochar in decreasing the accumulation of some genes (tetW, tetX, and sul2) in pakchoi, whereas an opposite tendency was observed for other genes (ermB and intI1). As the addition rate increased to 2%, the difference between the two biochars diminished, and a similar capacity of decreasing ARGs transfer was observed. The reduction in ARGs accumulation in pakchoi was highly related to the type of ARGs, the biochar addition level, and the aging of biochar. Our results provide insights into the naturally aged biochar on the fate of ARGs in a soil-plant system.",,,,,,Aged biochar; Antibiotic resistance gene; Fresh biochar; Pakchoi; Pot experiment; Rhizosphere,,,Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Land Consolidation (2019-ZD03); Natural Science Foundation of China (42177258),,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18941-5,35103947,10.1007/s11356-022-18941-5,,,0,001-028-908-536-915; 005-039-203-336-824; 005-278-873-084-679; 005-975-662-309-739; 006-178-513-454-136; 006-810-913-562-909; 006-977-895-956-342; 006-993-449-417-63X; 007-019-135-088-80X; 010-202-955-588-483; 010-338-440-799-268; 011-928-383-460-917; 012-078-978-268-279; 013-345-058-126-016; 013-465-881-508-682; 014-126-432-047-42X; 014-729-971-481-359; 015-046-011-301-756; 017-954-183-640-97X; 023-524-515-006-21X; 026-440-029-252-483; 026-497-443-789-97X; 028-824-244-544-134; 029-367-343-157-282; 033-193-942-683-556; 035-452-197-317-818; 036-682-163-760-248; 039-160-365-632-333; 040-492-089-103-748; 042-741-682-062-569; 047-732-060-236-023; 053-976-198-994-300; 056-025-152-654-154; 056-359-855-235-95X; 058-782-528-051-724; 060-756-716-493-661; 061-728-097-587-658; 062-710-603-262-639; 063-440-697-595-432; 067-762-060-217-175; 073-548-639-804-045; 075-031-185-134-411; 076-880-951-420-39X; 086-196-709-810-930; 094-026-631-983-978; 098-082-927-462-057; 098-621-456-065-417; 104-405-262-391-977; 111-638-793-245-910; 114-541-024-137-411; 121-282-673-724-982; 122-331-575-669-937; 143-704-732-257-655; 144-688-331-167-869; 146-040-538-312-374; 163-693-684-972-092,0

There are many technologies for carbon apprehension and storage, but the most important one gaining attention is biochar technology. So, to carbonize and return different biological materials back to the farmland, a comprehensive study was proposed to characterize and evaluate the carbon (C) mineralization of biochars produced from different animal manures and crop straws. Six types of biochars were prepared from animal manures (poultry litter, swine and cattle manures) and crop straws (rice, soybean, and corn straws). The biochars were analyzed for chemical characteristics (elemental variables, thermal decomposition, cation exchange capacity, pH, electrical conductivity, specific surface area, and surface functional groups) and an incubation experiment was conducted to evaluate C mineralization from soil biochar mixture. Biochars produced from crop straws resulted to have more C as compared to the biochars produced from animal manures. Concentration of nitrogen was low, while P, K, Ca, and Mg were found reasonably higher in all biochars except swine manure biochar. The plant-derived biochars presented lower CO2 emissions when incorporated to soil at 1 and 2% of C. Varying but all the biochars prepared represented an alkaline pH. Biochars prepared from the crop straws resulted to have more C, alkaline in nature, high CEC, low CO2 emissions, can sequester C and more suitable to enhance the soil fertility in comparison to biochars produced from other sources.",10,1,955,955,Environmental chemistry; Mineralization (soil science); Chemistry; Cation-exchange capacity; Poultry litter; Soil chemistry; Manure; Soil fertility; Nitrogen; Biochar,,Animals; Carbon/chemistry; Cattle; Charcoal/chemistry; Manure; Poultry; Soil/chemistry; Swine,Manure; Soil; biochar; Charcoal; Carbon,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31969672/ https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57987-8.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatSR..10..955S/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976609 http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57987-8 https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/characterization-and-carbon-mineralization-of-biochars-produced-f https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31969672 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57987-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57987-8,31969672,10.1038/s41598-020-57987-8,3004928627,PMC6976609,0,001-239-572-580-620; 004-338-094-269-418; 007-841-118-017-088; 008-331-703-212-542; 009-514-434-740-248; 010-103-660-729-812; 010-940-670-161-982; 013-019-996-884-311; 014-908-123-717-625; 015-818-626-255-909; 017-472-433-479-911; 019-157-481-659-821; 020-084-884-037-251; 021-020-645-106-567; 021-389-062-627-627; 021-978-414-993-424; 028-627-169-432-569; 028-656-050-935-057; 029-617-139-472-452; 030-306-929-442-183; 031-528-662-129-509; 032-282-764-527-697; 034-660-691-853-472; 036-666-308-380-829; 040-349-048-074-360; 045-500-593-836-624; 048-334-835-823-497; 052-144-488-518-902; 052-914-766-200-864; 053-498-910-633-573; 059-131-517-002-078; 060-457-082-527-961; 060-540-731-083-019; 065-511-688-716-333; 070-863-893-011-738; 071-480-400-593-951; 072-648-720-662-410; 076-244-705-085-867; 079-443-096-095-517; 080-716-866-630-78X; 082-843-713-922-524; 085-560-907-942-995; 085-785-710-536-288; 087-522-986-237-56X; 091-120-913-247-700; 095-251-328-074-47X; 097-229-554-278-149; 101-649-118-457-718; 102-307-069-255-349; 108-263-742-514-790; 125-617-070-829-723; 139-606-223-423-156; 143-812-466-828-854; 160-552-824-931-658; 188-575-507-931-425; 190-027-124-347-779; 191-065-372-281-258,29

Biochar application has appealing effects on soil improvement and potential capacity to affect NPSF, but the process is poorly understood. Here, our study demonstrated that biochar amendment can effectively alleviate the NPSF and this biochar effect is strongly linked to soil microorganism in a sanqi (Panax notoginseng) production system. High-throughput sequencing showed that the bacterial and fungal communities were altered with biochar amendment, and bacterial community is more sensitive to biochar amendment than the fungal community. Biochar amendment significantly increased the soil bacterial diversity, but the fungal diversity was not significantly different between biochar-amended and non-amended soils. Moreover, we found that biochar amendment significantly increased the soil pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter, available phosphorus, available potassium, and C/N ratio. The correlation analysis showed that these increased soil chemical variables have a significantly positive correlation with the bacterial diversity. Further analysis of the soil microbial composition demonstrated that biochar soil amendment enriched the beneficial bacterium Bacillus and Lysobacter but suppressed pathogens Fusarium and Ilyonectria. In addition, we verified that biochar had no direct effect on the pathogen Fusarium solani, but can directly enrich biocontrol bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In short, biochar application can mitigate NPSF is mostly due to the fact that biochar soil amendment modified the soil microbiome, especially inhibited pathogens by enriching beneficial bacterium with antagonistic activity against pathogen.",11,,799,799,Soil water; Chemistry; Soil pH; Lysobacter; Fusarium solani; Amendment; Organic matter; Biochar; Agronomy; Microbial population biology,Panax notoginseng; biochar amendment; microbial community; negative plant-soil feedback; soil-borne disease,,,Agriculture Research System of China,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00799/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201025 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32411119/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32411119 https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00799/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411119,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00799,32411119,10.3389/fmicb.2020.00799,3022096718,PMC7201025,0,001-020-299-979-027; 002-126-015-873-848; 002-537-589-051-890; 003-253-766-567-153; 003-591-666-328-19X; 003-759-792-240-638; 004-446-369-298-313; 007-869-499-607-368; 008-068-320-957-947; 009-569-596-436-685; 010-249-526-178-775; 011-364-663-695-365; 011-592-201-871-787; 012-958-443-960-862; 013-455-492-256-11X; 013-609-892-804-663; 014-227-825-658-89X; 015-268-386-806-236; 016-088-094-981-065; 017-545-766-958-552; 018-700-367-666-345; 019-507-316-019-350; 019-789-856-611-484; 022-612-354-547-958; 022-903-789-244-147; 023-820-889-770-497; 025-306-354-387-310; 033-131-162-715-082; 033-189-553-548-906; 035-297-923-812-817; 038-575-306-394-388; 039-890-085-853-910; 043-384-673-628-691; 044-058-925-687-421; 045-765-037-152-671; 046-702-710-091-281; 046-846-346-602-809; 046-910-288-014-286; 047-322-274-693-519; 047-712-125-213-300; 048-862-364-198-056; 048-999-831-738-54X; 050-506-465-181-203; 052-490-254-013-591; 052-922-654-595-582; 053-156-940-789-958; 053-807-614-553-460; 054-131-404-238-322; 054-490-928-400-049; 054-722-689-424-907; 054-981-931-170-770; 057-177-268-510-450; 062-294-246-240-916; 064-413-166-868-844; 066-724-824-519-293; 068-200-553-787-688; 070-353-050-266-126; 071-053-535-941-97X; 071-546-387-632-029; 080-220-304-017-079; 082-561-360-847-85X; 083-116-756-288-717; 083-482-290-304-243; 095-248-857-359-334; 106-693-719-816-704; 107-587-682-242-264; 108-749-099-533-035; 112-036-832-757-766; 130-332-915-757-656; 131-474-734-836-494; 132-930-580-135-785; 133-160-232-234-048; 150-688-081-616-680; 174-685-171-957-400; 175-857-545-559-365; 184-462-136-906-231,19

This experiment revealed that peanut shell biochar (PSB) has highest reduction of 78% concentration of Pb in plant roots. The maize straw biochar (MSB) has significantly decreased Zn and Cd concentration (mg/kg dry weight) in Chinese cabbage than other treatments of biochars. The plants of Chinese cabbage have exhibited an efficient transport capability for Zn and Cd. The biochars have reduced exchangeable form of Cd/Zn, enhanced residual heavy metals, and consequently diminished accumulation of heavy metals in plants.

This was the first study to show Fe-impregnated biochar can eliminate H2S production. The novel study evaluated biochar addition on H2S reduction and nutrient concentrations using three experiments to test the effect of: 1) biochar concentration, 2) biochar particle size, and 3) Fe-impregnated biochar using triplicate lab-scale reactors. At the highest biochar dose (1.82 g biochar/g manure TS), H2S production was 90.5% less than the control treatment (351 mL H2S/kg VS). Biochar particle size did not significantly affect H2S concentration. The Fe-impregnated biochar (0.5 g biochar/g manure TS) reactors had no H2S detected in the CSB-Fe system. Methane (CH4) in the biochar and control treatments were not significantly different in all three experiments.

This study focused on the impact of pyrolysis temperature on biochars' physicochemical properties derived from two agricultural residue materials (pigeon pea stalk and bamboo) pyrolysed at different pyrolysis temperatures (400, 500 and 600 °C) for a holding time of 1 h. The bamboo and pigeon pea stalk were characterized, as well as their resulting biochar samples (proximate, ultimate, SEM, BET, FTIR and XRD). For both the biomass materials, biomass composition had great influence on the biochar yield and properties. More mass fraction of lignin in the bamboo biomass yields more biochar (32.20–27.00%) compared to pigeon pea stalk biomass (29.80–21.70%) at the same pyrolysis temperature. The mass fraction of fixed carbon of biochars was observed to be in the range of 81.85–85.68%, which were much higher than the biomass. The mass fraction of carbon in the derived biochars were in the range of 76.17–88.43%. The biochar with the highest mass fraction of carbon was found at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C for both biomass-derived biochars. Biochars with low atomic ratio of H/C (0.03–0.06) and O/C (0.09–0.25) confirmed their highly carbonized, aromatized and hydrophobic nature. The BET surface area of biochar samples were ranged from 16.90 to 307.10 m2 g−1, biochar with the higher surface area was obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C. At the same pyrolysis temperature, bamboo derived biochars were higher total pore volume (0.057–0.18 cm3 g−1) in respect to pigeon pea stalk derived biochars. The alkalinity of all biochars increased in tandem with the pyrolysis temperature and found to be in the range of 7.25–10.14. The acidic and polar functional groups were successively removed and resulted in a more hydrophobic well-organized carbon layered biochar at a temperature of 600 °C. The biochars were enriched with sylvite, calcite, and silicates of Mg, Mn, and Ca signifying its heterogonous characteristics and increased ash content.",3,,100101,,Environmental chemistry; Carbonization; Chemistry; Bamboo; Biomass; Lignin; BET theory; Pyrolysis; Carbon; Biochar,,,,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666790821000616,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clet.2021.100101,,10.1016/j.clet.2021.100101,3159564270,,0,000-128-683-910-524; 001-075-001-237-02X; 001-947-924-895-763; 002-888-147-103-846; 004-758-306-376-671; 006-085-744-344-441; 008-078-464-738-769; 008-202-644-103-571; 009-130-727-363-076; 009-311-660-197-212; 010-217-700-183-697; 010-311-187-587-295; 010-598-342-847-028; 010-770-057-076-350; 011-239-811-827-487; 012-078-978-268-279; 012-621-993-218-407; 012-808-985-022-375; 014-913-752-375-302; 016-164-478-595-085; 020-761-764-821-987; 022-689-336-468-725; 023-447-093-741-815; 025-932-792-657-286; 025-976-065-797-981; 026-129-451-747-359; 026-133-648-801-808; 026-485-382-410-728; 027-643-337-564-311; 028-463-839-015-337; 029-800-947-417-457; 032-421-535-123-733; 032-587-036-956-888; 033-022-207-067-806; 039-891-426-705-516; 039-919-906-866-599; 041-537-158-178-149; 041-800-403-643-012; 042-364-715-759-40X; 045-733-241-571-922; 046-432-884-164-420; 047-910-069-314-533; 049-805-774-035-888; 051-117-719-455-276; 053-146-787-813-819; 053-866-142-451-422; 054-970-674-082-134; 055-246-679-814-241; 056-179-552-328-683; 056-402-509-152-562; 056-934-096-234-195; 058-344-554-850-79X; 060-457-082-527-961; 060-903-058-804-719; 062-048-331-815-24X; 063-045-251-180-339; 063-926-435-719-829; 066-921-965-734-299; 067-377-981-564-621; 068-009-474-117-576; 069-859-457-834-845; 070-863-893-011-738; 072-401-893-804-734; 078-133-394-903-156; 078-319-436-017-933; 081-468-192-294-746; 084-438-416-223-624; 084-666-978-206-900; 087-455-749-743-357; 094-496-802-988-922; 096-621-822-205-422; 096-867-866-069-354; 097-562-385-907-387; 098-097-063-108-158; 111-843-581-861-781; 112-638-114-787-192; 115-509-937-590-284; 116-030-337-783-009; 116-842-869-497-162; 117-636-747-485-058; 121-775-139-640-223; 123-106-411-013-849; 130-133-155-205-899; 135-468-892-650-403; 136-153-059-675-555; 141-418-642-923-722; 150-896-478-723-712; 151-318-364-684-593; 152-315-882-328-786; 155-440-625-680-334; 155-946-241-318-676; 157-958-486-962-751; 167-564-743-484-393; 180-890-361-036-207,16

Fidel; David A. Laird; Timothy B. Parkin,"Biochar has been shown to influence soil CO and NO emissions following application to soil, but the presence of carbonates in biochars has largely confounded efforts to differentiate among labile and recalcitrant C pools in biochar and establish their timeframe of influence. Understanding the mechanism, magnitude, and duration of biochar C pools' influence on C and N dynamics is imperative to successful implementation of biochar for C sequestration. Here we therefore aim to assess biochar organic and inorganic C pool impacts on CO and NO emissions from soil amended with two untreated biochars, inorganic carbon (as NaCO), acid (HCl) and bicarbonate (NaHCO) extracts of the biochars, and acid and bicarbonate/acid-washed biochars during a 140-d soil incubation. We hypothesized that (i) both biochar labile organic carbon (LOC) and inorganic carbon (IC) pools contribute significantly to short-term (<1 mo) CO emissions from biochar-amended soil, (ii) biochars will influence the size of soil NH and NO pools, and (iii) changes in soil inorganic N pools will affect soil NO emissions. All biochar, biochar extract, and carbonate treatments (12 total) increased CO produced during the initial ≤48 h of the incubation relative to controls, indicating that both biochar LOC and IC contribute to CO emissions. Of these treatments, only bicarbonate extracts of the biochars increased total C losses significantly. However, treatment impacts on soil NO production were not significant despite significant effects of select treatments on inorganic N pools. Overall, results indicate that biochars contain small LOC and IC pools that are stabilized by a larger recalcitrant organic C pool.",46,3,505,513,Environmental chemistry; Total inorganic carbon; Soil conditioner; Slash-and-char; Soil organic matter; Chemistry; Carbon sequestration; Bicarbonate; Charcoal; Biochar,,Carbon/chemistry; Carbon Dioxide/chemistry; Charcoal; Nitrous Oxide/chemistry; Soil,Soil; biochar; Carbon Dioxide; Charcoal; Carbon; Nitrous Oxide,National Science Foundation; Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20173247710 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/46/3/505 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2134/jeq2016.09.0369 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28724102 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28724102,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2016.09.0369,28724102,10.2134/jeq2016.09.0369,2608279994,,0,001-298-202-769-979; 002-176-140-520-190; 003-732-239-344-415; 011-102-067-314-984; 015-975-430-001-420; 018-822-473-650-65X; 022-710-227-296-251; 024-387-946-516-957; 028-765-139-404-714; 030-356-806-220-500; 034-010-237-534-469; 037-745-479-733-141; 039-786-830-123-089; 040-824-107-977-341; 044-339-348-027-634; 044-565-223-280-64X; 044-886-747-610-379; 046-910-288-014-286; 048-573-634-090-416; 051-327-791-645-774; 052-595-984-911-749; 054-142-761-552-436; 057-374-680-060-845; 064-734-199-890-244; 066-415-629-455-82X; 066-830-599-720-036; 070-353-050-266-126; 077-279-632-991-098; 081-965-203-455-443; 090-645-466-276-58X; 094-010-606-056-631; 095-093-825-623-096; 096-184-526-064-431; 097-028-588-372-845; 098-238-442-833-495; 099-101-159-626-932; 123-125-385-542-547; 125-523-300-302-285; 128-252-096-352-433; 138-279-301-804-973; 140-676-460-145-750; 151-748-808-344-89X; 157-458-799-934-021; 184-261-773-220-661,21

Ravi,"Biochar is a recalcitrant material obtained after pyrolysis of labile biomass under oxygen-limited condition. The conversion of biomass into biochar is considered to be a sustainable way of generating bioenergy, minimizing the emission of greenhouse gases and managing the waste. Recently, the amendment of biochar in soil gained attention due to its multiple soil ameliorating features. Many studies have investigated the effect of biochar particle size on the physicochemical and hydraulic properties of relatively loose agricultural soil. However, such study is rarely conducted for compacted soil suitable for bioengineered structures. The objective of the current study is to investigate the effect of biochar particle size on the hydraulic conductivity of compacted soil for bioengineered structures. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) of different compacted soils amended with biochar of different particle sizes ranging from 0.075 to 4.75 mm has been investigated. The results showed that the amendment of 5% to 15% (w/w) biochar of different particle sizes led to the change in Ksat of the silty sand. When compared with bare soil, a higher Ksat with biochar of particle size larger than 0.425 mm and a lower Ksat with particles of size smaller than 0.425 mm was observed. However, in pure sand, a lower Ksat irrespective of particle size of biochar was observed and the lowest Ksat was noted with biochar of particle size smaller than 150 mm. These changes in the Ksat after biochar amendment were attributed to the alteration of pore structure mainly, inter-pores of the soil, which is controlled by the particle size of the biochar. The findings of the present study could be useful for the field application i.e. in bioengineered structures.",,,1,11,Particle; Soil science; Soil water; Particle size; Amendment; Biomass; Pyrolysis; Environmental science; Biochar; Hydraulic conductivity,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13399-020-01226-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-020-01226-7,,10.1007/s13399-020-01226-7,3120099115,,0,002-112-386-894-78X; 002-372-284-489-522; 003-441-282-502-263; 003-895-742-038-403; 006-323-399-981-845; 008-919-849-860-734; 010-531-942-576-755; 011-590-055-866-04X; 012-744-057-723-54X; 013-911-608-335-175; 016-125-450-225-013; 017-695-980-234-655; 020-900-559-922-348; 023-610-670-322-029; 024-524-012-030-492; 026-544-088-790-026; 031-218-903-265-20X; 034-658-955-805-173; 037-889-549-819-884; 037-966-117-675-756; 038-210-187-464-563; 039-082-531-254-390; 039-915-045-737-649; 047-146-316-846-107; 050-463-463-685-11X; 053-295-226-109-871; 053-498-910-633-573; 055-713-331-218-860; 056-874-383-927-515; 058-257-607-146-451; 068-510-913-554-508; 071-400-089-018-491; 071-791-575-202-180; 081-435-433-766-214; 086-645-798-594-248; 090-145-532-541-935; 093-747-226-584-598; 094-081-972-219-806; 095-011-824-587-300; 095-748-641-015-074; 098-160-750-990-786; 098-238-442-833-495; 104-513-340-688-839; 106-693-719-816-704; 109-422-399-668-929; 116-225-309-730-882; 119-847-806-986-534; 123-875-560-683-877; 137-792-952-971-282; 145-613-406-998-692; 151-241-352-131-390; 153-057-427-790-976,4

Crowley; Genxing Pan; Lianqing Li,"Biochar can be an effective amendment for immobilizing heavy metals in contaminated soils but has variable effects depending on its chemical and physical properties and those of the treated soil. To investigate the range of biochar's effects on heavy metal accumulation in plants in responses to the variation of soil, biochar and plant, we carried out a meta-analysis of the literature that was published before March 2016. A total of 1298 independent observations were collected from 74 published papers. Results showed that across all studies, biochar addition to soils resulted in average decreases of 38, 39, 25 and 17%, respectively, in the accumulation of Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn in plant tissues. The effect of biochar on heavy metal concentrations in plants varied depending on soil properties, biochar type, plant species, and metal contaminants. The largest decreases in plant heavy metal concentrations occurred in coarse-textured soils amended with biochar. Biochar had a relatively small effect on plant tissue Pb concentrations, but a large effect on plant Cu concentrations when applied to alkaline soils. Plant uptake of Pb, Cu and Zn was less in soils with higher organic carbon contents. Manure-derived biochar was the most effective for reducing Cd and Pb concentrations in plants as compared to biochars derived from other feedstock. Biochar having a high pH and used at high application rates resulted in greater decreases in plant heavy metal uptake. The meta-analysis provides useful guidelines on the range of effects that can be anticipated for different biochar materials in different plant-soil systems.",222,,76,85,Environmental chemistry; Alkali soil; Total organic carbon; Soil water; Chemistry; Raw material; Heavy metals; Amendment; Metal; Biochar,Availability; Biochar; Heavy metal contamination; Meta-analysis; Plant uptake; Soil remediation,"Charcoal; Metals, Heavy/pharmacokinetics; Plants; Soil; Soil Pollutants","Metals, Heavy; Soil; Soil Pollutants; biochar; Charcoal",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Ministry of Agriculture of China,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479718305176 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479718305176 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29804035/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804035 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29804035,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.05.004,29804035,10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.05.004,2804916359,,0,001-017-373-093-666; 001-971-913-579-933; 003-541-942-398-296; 003-825-243-170-06X; 004-331-505-940-199; 005-039-203-336-824; 005-373-766-940-746; 007-611-302-125-536; 008-795-580-345-008; 010-931-858-425-324; 011-081-048-348-564; 011-364-663-695-365; 011-788-424-387-604; 012-078-978-268-279; 013-365-036-889-758; 013-852-936-421-833; 014-077-828-052-251; 014-157-275-215-03X; 014-554-048-386-604; 016-164-478-595-085; 019-782-727-911-120; 023-820-889-770-497; 024-387-946-516-957; 025-306-354-387-310; 026-371-019-768-244; 026-915-707-994-627; 026-916-117-990-751; 027-532-014-193-85X; 028-897-047-783-459; 030-626-098-349-107; 031-780-288-351-12X; 032-212-533-477-158; 033-376-413-889-999; 033-589-482-460-183; 038-918-751-374-600; 041-139-503-416-264; 041-409-363-066-158; 042-521-479-056-775; 043-843-523-826-756; 046-487-761-828-010; 046-910-288-014-286; 047-495-405-656-01X; 049-225-452-457-972; 052-595-984-911-749; 053-251-093-475-792; 053-877-165-398-525; 054-019-861-331-143; 054-879-041-435-270; 057-625-221-733-215; 057-932-813-540-257; 058-208-013-032-595; 060-457-082-527-961; 060-704-280-226-700; 063-491-631-678-403; 066-651-365-477-236; 066-688-856-005-195; 067-570-957-195-955; 070-432-024-771-474; 072-644-808-450-860; 073-089-960-945-40X; 074-774-417-853-273; 078-104-468-587-430; 081-630-249-066-166; 082-701-897-161-024; 087-511-814-264-111; 088-719-228-765-350; 089-263-867-425-508; 092-399-849-791-10X; 094-759-287-369-861; 096-516-022-509-212; 098-238-442-833-495; 101-761-355-983-789; 109-422-399-668-929; 110-920-701-277-265; 111-255-833-574-420; 116-122-167-280-553; 119-747-570-955-185; 136-393-909-828-400; 146-276-024-839-401; 148-515-721-615-09X; 166-521-546-451-297; 177-735-223-862-086; 184-261-773-220-661,88

For that, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a low biochar and biofertilizer addition to improve soil characteristics and the use of nutrients to reduce the doses of chemical fertilizer. For that, we measured the initial effect of biochar addition on the soil characteristics. Then, to evaluate the changes produced by biochar and biofertilizer on cultivated soil, we carried out a greenhouse experiment with Physalis ixocarpa for two crop cycles. We also studied the nutrient use efficiency, comparing chemical fertilization at 100% (without biochar) against 50% and 20% with biochar on crop yield, plant height, fruit weight, and root length. Finally, we compared the combination of biochar and biofertilizer with the treatments mentioned earlier. The results showed that after adding 0.2% of bamboo biochar, bulk density (BD) decreased while CEC, as well as OM, Pav, Fe, and Cu contents, increased in the soil. The combination of biochar and biofertilizer improved WHC, Pav, and OM comparing to the soil added with biochar.

(amaranth) was hydroponically grown in different concentrations of biochar amended nutrient solution to investigate the mineral elements migration and physiological response of amaranth as affected by biochar. Our results showed that exposure to 26.6 g/L of biochar greatly increased the root and shoot K, Na and Al content, while 2.6 g/L of biochar greatly increased the root Ca and Mg content. The uptake of K and Al notably altered other elements' accumulation in shoots and roots upon the biochar exposure. The ratio of Ca: K in shoots and Mg: K in roots were negatively correlated to the biochar concentrations, while the ratio of Al: Ca and Al: Mg in roots were positively related to the biochar concentrations. The Al: Fe ratio was also polynomial correlated to the concentrations of biochar. The addition of biochar beyond 2.6 g/L resulted in the cell membrane and DNA damages in roots. The activity of SOD and CAT in 6.7 g/L biochar treated roots was significantly elevated as compared to the ones in other biochar treatments and was almost 2-fold of the control. The photosynthetic Fv/Fm intensity and subcellular structure in leaves were also compromised upon exposure to 26.6 g/L biochar. Taken together, biochar could significantly alter the mineral migration in amaranth and physiologically damage in the plants.

However, there is lack of complex, investigative studies describing the influence of biomass properties and pyrolysis conditions on the pore structure of biochars. The aim of our study was to evaluate a wide range of gathered agriculture residues and elevated pyrolysis temperature on the biochar surface properties and pore composition, predicting biochar behaviour in the soil. The biomass of herbaceous and wood plants was treated by slow pyrolysis, with the final temperature ranging from 400 to 600 °C. Specific surface ranged from 124 to 511 cm2 g-1 at wood biochar and from 3.19 to 192 cm2 g-1 at herbaceous biochar. The main properties influencing biochar pore composition were increasing pyrolysis temperatures and lignin (logarithmically) and ash contents (linearly) of biomass. Increasing lignin contents and pyrolysis temperatures caused the highest biochar micropore volume. The total biochar pore volume was higher of wood biomass (0.08-0.3 cm-3 g-1). Biochars of wood origin were characterised by skeletal density ranging from 1.479 to 2.015 cm3 g-1 and herbaceous ones 1.506-1.943 cm3 g-1, and the envelope density reached 0.982 cm3 g-1 at biochar of wheat grain origin and was generally higher at biochars of herbaceous origin. Density was not pyrolysis temperature dependent.",39,6,1381,1395,Environmental chemistry; Slash-and-char; Chemistry; Raw material; Biomass; Lignin; Pyrolysis; Charcoal; Biochar; Agronomy; Porosity,Herbaceous biomass; Pore volume; Sorption; Specific surface area; Wood biomass,Agriculture; Biomass; Charcoal/analysis; Hot Temperature; Lignin/analysis; Plants/chemistry; Porosity; Soil/chemistry; Surface Properties,Soil; biochar; Charcoal; Lignin,Česká Zemědělská Univerzita v Praze (CIGA No. 20172015),https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10653-017-0004-9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664248 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10653-017-0004-9 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28664248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-017-0004-9,28664248,10.1007/s10653-017-0004-9,2725991393,,1,002-112-386-894-78X; 005-355-154-977-290; 007-915-141-202-694; 009-006-569-024-117; 010-311-187-587-295; 010-871-129-446-780; 011-680-778-315-291; 013-550-648-417-393; 014-946-059-252-25X; 016-164-478-595-085; 017-219-177-972-563; 017-472-433-479-911; 019-593-858-718-459; 020-569-335-610-014; 024-282-338-548-292; 025-672-485-438-966; 026-605-507-516-950; 033-022-207-067-806; 035-244-224-349-211; 044-565-223-280-64X; 046-146-273-543-31X; 049-551-430-144-24X; 049-835-303-096-200; 051-117-719-455-276; 051-242-232-940-31X; 053-498-910-633-573; 056-912-354-635-008; 058-807-597-249-492; 061-322-609-324-780; 067-994-988-068-78X; 068-058-347-452-516; 068-944-393-652-849; 071-354-780-315-445; 072-644-808-450-860; 080-318-966-071-07X; 085-560-907-942-995; 087-511-814-264-111; 089-877-043-154-182; 091-016-189-371-769; 091-065-676-370-57X; 095-908-581-960-073; 098-159-856-924-607; 099-326-690-284-516; 109-543-184-361-605; 122-359-859-258-667; 123-125-385-542-547; 125-059-465-730-388; 138-305-175-454-12X; 139-541-353-878-795; 160-019-098-024-918; 160-552-824-931-658; 177-350-363-004-65X; 184-325-051-373-391,14

New methodologies are emerging to reduce the cost such as enriching biochar with nutrients that match crops and soil requirements. However, the effects of biochar-based fertilisers on plant yield and soil nutrient availability have not been widely examined. This study investigated the effects of a novel organo-mineral biochar fertiliser in comparison to organic and commercial biochar fertiliser on ginger (Zingiber officinale Canton). There were four treatments: (1) commercial organic fertiliser (5 t ha−1), as the control; (2) commercial biochar-based fertiliser (5 t ha−1); (3) organo-mineral biochar fertiliser at low rate (3 t ha−1); and (4) organo-mineral biochar fertiliser at high rate (7.5 t ha−1). A replicated pot trial was established with black dermosol soil and ten replicate pots for each treatment. Ginger was planted and grown for 30 weeks. Plant growth, biomass, foliar nutrients and water extractable soil nutrients including phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) were examined. High rate organo-mineral biochar fertiliser increased soil P and K availability at week 30 (harvest) after planting, compared to all other treatments and low rate organo-mineral biochar fertiliser performed similarly to the organic control for P and K. High rate organo-mineral biochar fertiliser increased total foliar nutrient content at week 30 in P, K and Ca compared to commercial biochar fertiliser. High rate organo-mineral biochar fertiliser improved the commercial value of ginger (+ 36%) due to a shift in the proportion of higher grade rhizomes. Low rate organo-mineral biochar fertiliser plants displayed similar yield, total dry and aboveground biomass to commercial organic fertiliser. Commercial biochar fertiliser had significantly lower biomass measures compared with other treatments as the rate applied had lower nutrient concentrations. Our results show organo-mineral biochar fertilisers could be substituted for commercial organic fertilisers at low rates to maintain similar yield or applied at high rates to increase commercial value where economically feasible.",19,2,668,682,Crop yield; Nutrient; Nutrient cycle; Sowing; Organic fertilizer; Biomass; Environmental science; Phosphorus; Biochar; Agronomy,,,,University of the Sunshine Coast; Griffith University (AU),https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/short-term-effects-of-organo-mineral-enriched-biochar-fertiliser- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-018-2061-9 https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/385585 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6294862 https://www.scilit.net/article/bf3d5f529612fcd25e2258bda614fb16?action=show-references,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-018-2061-9,,10.1007/s11368-018-2061-9,2810817210,,0,001-020-299-979-027; 001-726-873-332-039; 004-973-949-116-453; 006-707-218-373-190; 008-587-527-288-968; 009-500-499-513-84X; 013-482-477-573-989; 014-962-109-043-780; 015-111-816-353-826; 017-015-170-569-929; 017-307-907-033-737; 019-347-275-784-987; 020-525-474-305-525; 022-721-323-014-238; 023-341-514-331-465; 023-770-155-471-057; 026-459-668-136-913; 026-903-416-234-662; 028-559-249-001-484; 028-656-050-935-057; 030-553-054-957-966; 032-248-777-496-085; 033-191-771-125-621; 034-010-237-534-469; 035-229-011-764-280; 038-575-306-394-388; 039-775-040-456-520; 041-409-363-066-158; 041-435-616-849-126; 041-951-102-851-326; 044-614-859-913-017; 045-832-685-526-368; 046-445-011-270-921; 046-622-430-054-929; 047-700-324-796-301; 047-957-876-956-725; 051-723-924-670-637; 058-835-522-762-492; 061-284-268-001-830; 062-806-358-601-823; 065-281-086-727-480; 067-541-204-977-677; 067-951-223-451-971; 071-247-721-522-416; 071-480-400-593-951; 071-571-681-707-460; 077-359-456-994-221; 077-643-104-118-306; 078-908-953-276-867; 082-019-835-903-596; 082-425-383-350-380; 084-628-624-945-186; 085-560-907-942-995; 088-050-046-342-873; 089-820-369-636-563; 095-942-339-311-867; 096-941-725-873-448; 103-842-351-115-455; 105-644-444-715-017; 106-377-796-099-636; 108-718-785-452-225; 111-558-911-482-678; 117-277-743-795-356; 119-747-570-955-185; 120-311-179-505-796; 123-125-385-542-547; 124-951-217-380-332; 125-788-826-417-750; 127-729-935-594-185; 128-232-231-704-107; 140-318-409-480-780; 148-944-481-519-757; 151-778-124-421-45X; 154-619-666-685-522; 156-845-207-586-267; 169-119-142-871-491,23

Their high persistence and leaching potential make them probable risk to the ecosystems. In this study, biochar, the biomass-derived solid material, was produced from oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) and rice husk (RH) through pyrolysis process. Feedstock and pyrolysis variables can control biochar sorption capacity. Therefore, the present study attempts to evaluate effects of three pyrolysis variables (temperature, heating rate and retention time) on abilities of biochars for removal of imazapic and imazapyr herbicides from soil. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimizing the variables to achieve maximum sorption performance of the biochars. Experimental data were interpreted accurately by quadratic models. Based on the results, sorption capacities of both biochars raised when temperature decreased to 300 °C, mainly because of increased biochars effective functionality in sorption of polar molecules. Heating rate of 3°C/min provided optimum conditions to maximize the sorption capacities of both biochars. Retention time of about 1 h and 3 h were found to be the best for EFB and RH biochars, respectively. EFB biochar was more efficient in removal of the herbicides, especially imazapyr due to its chemical composition and higher polarity index (0.42) rather than RH biochar (0.39). Besides, higher cation exchange capacity (CEC) values of EFB biochar (83.90 cmolc/kg) in comparison with RH biochar (70.73 cmolc/kg) represented its higher surface polarity effective in sorption of the polar herbicides.",193,,201,210,Leaching (agriculture); Chemistry; Cation-exchange capacity; Imazapyr; Imazapic; Pyrolysis; Pulp and paper industry; Biochar; Sorption; Agronomy; Husk,Polar herbicides; Pyrolysis; Response surface methodology; Sorption,Adsorption; Charcoal/chemistry; Fruit/chemistry; Herbicides/chemistry; Oryza/chemistry; Soil/chemistry; Soil Pollutants/chemistry,Herbicides; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Charcoal,ministry of higher education; Malaysia under fundamental research,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28226259/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28226259 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479717301433,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.02.035,28226259,10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.02.035,2594132708,,1,000-085-889-286-15X; 002-226-859-444-320; 002-866-877-716-778; 003-297-218-031-221; 003-825-243-170-06X; 008-068-320-957-947; 008-461-528-897-120; 008-653-919-313-459; 009-346-871-127-193; 010-170-335-431-14X; 013-026-945-650-131; 013-550-648-417-393; 014-085-237-376-457; 016-164-478-595-085; 018-359-518-922-523; 019-228-321-068-446; 026-605-507-516-950; 027-643-337-564-311; 027-717-039-104-367; 030-074-972-052-834; 030-308-625-867-034; 031-870-895-249-724; 034-325-330-575-069; 036-702-933-462-34X; 038-927-461-493-366; 040-785-652-593-029; 043-394-459-989-380; 044-501-048-802-902; 044-569-780-780-282; 048-967-037-806-115; 049-844-154-331-24X; 053-498-910-633-573; 055-050-502-702-231; 055-796-951-753-027; 056-550-701-309-27X; 061-777-231-781-031; 061-994-633-492-655; 062-018-539-769-628; 064-702-811-517-934; 065-848-759-187-832; 068-536-892-204-132; 069-325-077-189-884; 072-323-766-818-50X; 074-403-035-944-943; 075-989-706-768-950; 079-187-385-716-770; 081-300-711-676-983; 082-058-387-337-982; 086-419-129-321-263; 086-718-493-763-148; 094-426-039-253-186; 094-918-161-057-243; 096-516-022-509-212; 098-464-398-254-976; 099-101-159-626-932; 099-336-363-588-917; 101-649-118-457-718; 102-937-890-841-072; 103-574-435-768-260; 104-797-357-451-43X; 105-190-730-965-953; 108-848-538-643-708; 109-422-399-668-929; 111-107-637-159-823; 111-468-290-239-552; 112-263-888-441-357; 122-010-176-685-684; 122-122-340-998-970; 128-359-651-670-749; 143-049-749-881-325; 143-647-991-887-936; 146-187-334-310-496; 173-889-457-735-668; 174-147-088-290-424; 189-523-715-245-536; 197-235-089-355-765,24

Bacterial wilt disease is caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and difficult to control. In order to control bacterial wilt, rice hull biochar was applied to soil with different doses (0, 7.5, 15, 30 and 45 t ha-1) in a field trial. After three years, the influence of biochar on soil properties, incidence of bacterial wilt and microbial community were characterized. Biochar amendment significantly suppressed bacterial wilt through changing soil chemical properties and microbial composition. Compared with control, disease incidence and index of biochar amendments (7.5, 15, 30, and 45 t ha-1) significantly decreased. Disease incidence and index of biochar amendment (15 t ha-1) were the lowest. Compared to the unamended control, contents of soil organic matter in biochar amendments (15, 30 t ha-1), available nitrogen in biochar amendment (15 t ha-1), and urease activity in biochar amendments (7.5, 15 t ha-1) significantly increased. Biochar amendments (15, 30, and 45 t ha-1) increased the relative abundances of potential beneficial bacteria (Aeromicrobium, Bacillus, Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, Chlorochromatium, Chthoniobacter, Corynebacterium, Geobacillus, Leptospirillum, Marisediminicola, Microvirga, Pseudoxanthomonas, Telmatobacter). Biochar amendments (7.5, 30, and 45 t ha-1) reduced the relative abundances of denitrifying bacteria (Noviherbaspirillum, Reyranella, Thermus).

Vo; Pau Loke Show,"Banana peels waste can be utilised to produce high quality biochar that can be incorporated into the soil for sustainable production of crops. This research analysed several properties of the biochar produced from the banana peel biomasses at different temperatures, residence times and heating rates. This study focuses on the biochar yield and the EDX analysis of the biochar produced. Response surface methodology using central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize these parameters in the batch reactor pyrolysis system. These factors were operated in different ranges for banana peels, in which pyrolysis temperature (200 to 600°C), residence time (60 to 180 minutes) and heating rate (5 to 15°C min-1) were varied using 20 experiments respectively. Quality of the biochar was determined based on the biochar yield and O/C ratio. The optimum biochar chosen from the CCD model was applied to several pots of Ipomoea aquatica in different biochar dosage levels of 0, 3, 9 and 15 g (0, 1, 3 and 5 wt% of soil) respectively. Pot experiment was conducted with completely randomized design (CRD) of one factor with 5 replications to correlate the average plant heights with the biochar dosage levels. Results showed that biochar dosage of 1% yields the highest average final Ipomoea aquatica plant height of 37.04 cm, while the plants with biochar dosage of 5% wilted.",8,,,,Horticulture; Response surface methodology; Chemistry; Banana peel; Biomass; Ipomoea aquatica; Pyrolysis; Batch reactor; Biochar; Central composite design,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2020.637846/pdf https://www.scilit.net/article/2759b67d85546b657ec80171c29f95ef https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2020.637846/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2020.637846,,10.3389/fenrg.2020.637846,3131561033,,0,000-651-694-859-476; 000-761-227-274-185; 003-316-541-291-542; 005-604-300-287-007; 006-217-193-449-811; 016-463-309-175-434; 017-505-715-019-719; 028-346-572-364-016; 031-910-099-020-017; 033-509-614-530-065; 036-077-071-756-756; 046-356-104-131-774; 046-546-721-682-894; 047-530-213-752-083; 058-057-526-256-011; 064-396-979-574-155; 081-218-963-578-420; 082-746-302-008-960; 098-063-892-441-075; 134-611-214-163-334; 155-954-013-158-877; 160-942-820-660-348,7

The impacts of biochar on microbial growth, and consequently on the environmental fate of pollutants, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, wheat-straw-derived biochar was used to investigate how biochar amendment affected <jats:italic>Shewanella oneidensis</jats:italic> MR-1 growth and roxarsone transformation in water under anaerobic conditions. Three biochar with different physicochemical properties were used to mediate the roxarsone degradation. The results showed that the degradation rate of roxarsone could be accelerated by the increase of biochar pyrolysis temperature. From the characterization of biochar, the total specific surface area, micropore surface area and micropore volume of biochar increase, but the average pore diameter decreases as the pyrolysis temperature increases. Through infrared spectroscopy analysis, it was found that as the pyrolysis temperature increases, the degree of condensation of biochar increases, thereby increasing the pollutant removal rate. From the changes of the relative concentration of MR-1 and its secreted extracellular polymer content, the growth promotion ability of biochar also increases as the pyrolysis temperature increases. These results suggest that wheat-straw-derived biochar may be an important agent for activating microbial growth and can be used to accelerate the transformation of roxarsone, which could be a novel strategy for roxarsone remediation.</jats:p>",13,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.846228,,10.3389/fmicb.2022.846228,,,0,000-701-831-195-69X; 002-728-226-076-038; 002-747-158-269-738; 003-533-998-114-07X; 003-704-391-002-315; 008-911-997-722-599; 011-353-596-848-064; 013-465-055-853-046; 013-481-994-636-605; 014-367-794-099-339; 016-164-478-595-085; 017-019-067-484-44X; 017-422-251-908-169; 021-761-582-761-465; 021-907-183-338-722; 026-343-711-781-236; 026-446-899-704-604; 026-840-180-538-532; 030-889-019-135-667; 037-546-030-093-525; 046-928-191-864-300; 047-350-714-970-750; 047-810-448-783-067; 049-825-631-251-151; 051-164-462-072-190; 052-695-862-360-342; 053-015-821-805-469; 053-110-305-508-914; 065-281-086-727-480; 067-984-457-245-039; 074-069-637-757-087; 075-817-492-359-447; 077-137-135-430-325; 090-367-559-354-439; 096-096-454-127-957; 097-167-711-369-407; 106-844-885-698-761; 107-470-923-534-526; 127-167-953-696-693; 150-688-081-616-680,0

Several remediation techniques have been investigated to reduce the environmental impact of Cu-contaminated soil, including the use of organic amendments such as composts and biochars, which can bound part of the soluble fraction of the metal. The objective of this work is to study the effect of biochar and biochar plus compost addition on copper mobility, soil microbial biomass and growth of different plant species following remediation of a soil spiked with copper (1000 mg Cu kg−1). The contaminated soil was treated with 10 wt% of biochar or biochar plus compost. Different plant species (mustard, cress and ryegrass) were grown in the soil during 4 weeks. A significant reduction on the mobile form of Cu was observed in soils treated with biochar and biochar plus compost. The highest microbial biomass values were obtained in samples treated with biochar plus compost. After cress growth, the microbial biomass of soil treated with biochar plus compost was similar to that of non-polluted soil. The germination test showed increased root length in the amended soils compared to the contaminated soils. With respect to biomass growth of vegetable species in copper polluted soil, only ryegrass presented a satisfactory growth in the contaminated soil without the biochar treatment. For mustard and cress, biomass growth was only observed following biochar addition.",124,,223,232,Soil classification; Soil water; Soil conditioner; Slash-and-char; Compost; Environmental science; Environmental remediation; Biochar; Agronomy; Soil contamination,,,,Economy and Competitiveness Ministry of Spain,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5691951 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20183060602 http://oa.upm.es/56563/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096483051730286X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2017.05.014,,10.1016/j.ibiod.2017.05.014,2618002123,,0,002-753-753-176-799; 003-549-314-320-056; 007-487-559-824-054; 007-541-372-936-050; 009-529-433-564-563; 011-706-049-551-326; 011-808-672-266-09X; 025-293-830-275-847; 027-260-581-890-081; 027-943-945-559-609; 034-598-821-028-370; 034-957-847-338-002; 037-745-479-733-141; 039-241-355-898-327; 043-239-713-457-591; 043-756-318-789-831; 046-105-887-822-523; 052-244-542-031-66X; 056-861-562-617-472; 057-417-364-249-002; 061-659-880-172-685; 063-445-050-870-088; 065-281-086-727-480; 069-236-454-262-385; 070-378-844-530-380; 077-129-148-016-65X; 079-910-423-280-112; 082-183-287-581-091; 084-665-370-412-074; 091-118-909-391-811; 096-498-359-591-913; 096-792-048-267-726; 097-755-446-212-150; 100-685-804-040-017; 110-088-682-392-483; 112-131-778-678-316; 112-199-957-586-91X; 114-212-663-018-737; 116-336-423-390-078; 122-601-789-629-962; 125-419-808-870-873; 127-942-696-807-528; 138-952-329-620-065; 149-391-939-468-55X; 197-097-226-943-14X,40

Biochar produced from gasification of maize silage (δ13C of biochar ≈ − 13.8‰) was applied into the soil of the plantation (δ13C of SOM ≈ −23.5‰). Total and heterotrophic respirations were measured in control and biochar-treated plots, and the amount of biochar-derived carbon dioxide (CO2) was calculated using an isotopic mass balance method. Biochar mean residence time (MRT) was assessed using exponential decay models. The remaining amount of biochar at the end of the experiment was estimated by a soil isotopic mass balance. In the absence of plant roots, MRT of the more recalcitrant biochar fraction (96% of the total) was 24.3 years, significantly lower than expected from previous shorter-term studies or laboratory incubations. In the presence of plant roots, MRT decreased to 12.6 years, confirming the previously observed positive effect of roots on biochar decomposition. However, in the absence of roots, the biochar decreased the decomposition of original SOM by 16%, indicating long-lasting protective effect on SOM (negative priming effect). The soil isotopic mass balance suggested that part of the applied biochar could have been lost by downward migration. This study provides the first estimation of the biochar stability and priming effect on SOM in field conditions in the medium term.",55,1,67,78,Mineralization (soil science); δ13C; Soil organic matter; Chemistry; Short rotation coppice; Heterotroph; Carbon dioxide; Biochar; Agronomy; Field experiment,,,,Seventh Framework Programme,https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND606268260 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00374-018-1329-y https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00374-018-1329-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-018-1329-y,,10.1007/s00374-018-1329-y,2900299858,,0,000-280-632-517-884; 000-934-497-001-622; 001-298-202-769-979; 003-405-134-616-551; 004-203-884-572-384; 005-242-618-119-745; 005-574-689-564-230; 011-364-663-695-365; 013-550-648-417-393; 014-248-180-441-61X; 020-796-783-622-748; 022-445-339-768-677; 022-895-250-275-41X; 024-005-886-404-77X; 024-508-799-616-920; 026-440-029-252-483; 027-765-695-461-633; 028-787-258-832-436; 030-579-389-008-645; 030-866-252-890-675; 032-061-865-461-755; 033-899-180-640-342; 036-816-844-998-295; 037-180-455-067-329; 038-254-763-056-643; 039-883-174-907-954; 041-416-273-449-505; 042-296-203-785-127; 043-781-100-209-077; 044-701-798-427-722; 048-573-634-090-416; 050-538-987-297-285; 054-879-041-435-270; 056-929-052-595-777; 061-206-923-970-272; 061-728-097-587-658; 062-584-446-185-03X; 065-281-086-727-480; 072-823-145-732-958; 073-286-912-441-832; 075-162-190-378-39X; 076-739-577-440-469; 087-798-390-952-818; 088-147-095-234-108; 090-423-631-209-177; 098-238-442-833-495; 103-454-109-283-229; 109-422-399-668-929; 112-497-974-413-936; 121-761-987-463-947; 149-399-346-227-183; 151-748-808-344-89X; 154-024-274-018-840; 173-592-693-033-548,28

Results showed that biochar can effectively increase water-holding capacity and soil pH. Adding 2% biochar significantly decreased the N leach in the Albic soil and the Black soil by 12% and 15% ,respectively. While when 4% biochar was added,the N leaching in the Albic soil and the Black soil decreased by 13% and 5% ,respectively,compared with the treatments of adding 2% biochar. N fertilizer firstly adsorbed by biochar and then mixed with soil significantly decreased the N leach compared to soil mixed with fertilizer and biochar directly. The decrease N leaching effect of biochar varied among different N fertilizers. In the Albic soil,compared with the treatment of no biochar,adding 2% biochar decreased the N leaching of ammonium sulfate,potassium nitrate and urea by 8% ,15% and 12% ,respectively; while in the Black soil,adding 2% biochar decreased the N leaching of ammonium sulfate,potassium nitrate and urea by 5% ,18% and 12% ,respectively.",,,,,Environmental chemistry; Leaching (agriculture); Materials science; Soil pH; Potassium nitrate; Urea; Fertilizer; Ammonium sulfate; Nitrogen; Biochar; Agronomy,,,,,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-TRZW201302006.htm,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-TRZW201302006.htm,,,2376929118,,0,,0

Sometimes the biochar also seems not to be stable enough due to physical, chemical, and biological reactions in soils. In this study, three phosphorus-bearing materials, H3PO4, phosphate rock tailing (PRT), and triple superphosphate (TSP), were used as additives to wheat straw with a ratio of 1: 0.4–0.8 for biochar production at 500°C, aiming to alleviate carbon loss during pyrolysis and to increase biochar-C stabilization. All these additives remarkably increased the biochar yield from 31.7% (unmodified biochar) to 46.9%–56.9% (modified biochars). Carbon loss during pyrolysis was reduced from 51.7% to 35.5%–47.7%. Thermogravimetric analysis curves showed that the additives had no effect on thermal stability of biochar but did enhance its oxidative stability. Microbial mineralization was obviously reduced in the modified biochar, especially in the TSP-BC, in which the total CO2 emission during 60-d incubation was reduced by 67.8%, compared to the unmodified biochar. Enhancement of carbon retention and biochar stability was probably due to the formation of meta-phosphate or C-O-PO3, which could either form a physical layer to hinder the contact of C with O2 and bacteria, or occupy the active sites of the C band. Our results indicate that pre-treating biomass with phosphors-bearing materials is effective for reducing carbon loss during pyrolysis and for increasing biochar stabilization, which provides a novel method by which biochar can be designed to improve the carbon sequestration capacity.",9,12,e115373,,Environmental chemistry; Mineralization (soil science); Chemistry; Carbon sequestration; Biomass; Phosphorite; Pyrolysis; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Biochar,,Biomass; Carbon Sequestration; Charcoal/chemistry; Phosphorus/chemistry; Temperature,biochar; Charcoal; Phosphorus,,https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115373 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PLoSO...9k5373Z/abstract https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115373 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25531111 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115373 https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/phosphorus-assisted-biomass-thermal-conversion-reducing-carbon-lo https://paperity.org/p/60304691/phosphorus-assisted-biomass-thermal-conversion-reducing-carbon-loss-and-improving-biochar http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4274024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115373,25531111,10.1371/journal.pone.0115373,2132967875,PMC4274024,1,007-397-566-440-420; 007-898-112-491-448; 010-709-149-650-505; 011-870-909-951-616; 012-225-675-379-980; 013-019-996-884-311; 015-514-415-901-728; 015-712-322-200-794; 015-818-626-255-909; 016-382-775-486-948; 019-064-680-775-70X; 020-444-464-271-179; 028-803-267-849-050; 029-294-860-914-603; 030-382-287-804-107; 031-253-735-389-53X; 043-071-277-960-775; 043-572-551-523-232; 043-627-371-583-516; 049-741-591-071-835; 052-695-862-360-342; 054-797-639-555-673; 056-871-340-655-560; 059-681-407-612-410; 061-728-097-587-658; 062-727-923-436-192; 064-314-990-988-971; 065-221-491-409-65X; 071-480-400-593-951; 072-644-808-450-860; 072-648-097-064-629; 080-898-981-537-572; 087-511-814-264-111; 088-318-606-762-978; 097-699-852-604-324; 097-989-458-932-974; 099-101-159-626-932; 112-497-974-413-936; 116-037-697-464-134; 118-730-163-079-977; 132-723-143-258-195; 153-586-477-012-869,47

We investigated the effects of biochar fertilization on biomass, root morphology, plant nutrient concentrations, and the stoichiometry of plants and soil in a greenhouse experiment with Pinus massoniana (Lamb.) (PM) and Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. (CL) throughout the 2017 growing season immediately following biochar fertilization application. Four levels of biochar treatment were used, i.e., addition rates of 0 (control), 5 (low biochar), 10 (medium biochar), and 20 t ha−1 (high biochar). Biochar fertilization had no effect on biomass, fine root length, or fine root surface area. Biochar treatment, however, had significant effects on nutrient levels and their stoichiometry in both plants and soil. Detrended correspondence analysis suggested that increases in soil C:N, soil C:P, and soil N:P were associated with increases in plant nutrient levels, especially P concentration. Our results indicate that biochar fertilization prioritizes enhancing plant and soil nutrients over increasing height and diameter in the first growing season. A higher biochar fertilization dosage has a major influence on root morphology for PM and on P concentrations in the plant and soil for CL, probably through different growth characteristics and nutrient resorption rates. Further studies, particularly those considering long-term effects, are necessary before general recommendations regarding biochar application should be given.",10,8,612,,Growing season; Nutrient; Chemistry; Detrended correspondence analysis; Pinus massoniana; Cunninghamia; Biomass; Biochar; Agronomy; Human fertilization,,,,,https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/wsl/islandora/object/wsl%3A21105/ https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/10/8/612 https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/10/8/612/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10080612,,10.3390/f10080612,2962885139,,0,000-184-117-081-895; 002-035-226-550-324; 004-016-130-673-548; 005-616-977-344-999; 006-401-380-669-916; 007-344-779-927-911; 007-759-548-331-576; 008-124-415-939-85X; 010-088-309-369-095; 019-112-016-630-266; 024-387-946-516-957; 026-420-901-116-882; 029-605-760-934-346; 030-553-054-957-966; 035-863-379-477-579; 036-419-058-463-913; 036-816-844-998-295; 038-825-933-059-449; 039-043-495-504-29X; 042-721-674-974-13X; 043-488-266-952-730; 045-932-491-500-627; 046-374-393-547-168; 046-420-672-772-629; 048-884-775-484-193; 050-542-342-928-408; 051-097-201-371-427; 051-107-600-484-249; 058-835-522-762-492; 059-881-734-008-751; 061-732-359-184-018; 066-548-130-090-664; 067-045-290-263-175; 067-765-259-656-339; 068-313-806-460-52X; 070-353-050-266-126; 075-054-220-420-782; 087-196-709-733-484; 106-450-603-731-745; 106-999-506-881-248; 111-029-657-747-47X; 115-322-054-470-844; 116-140-151-459-689; 123-125-385-542-547; 124-167-333-217-349; 126-719-170-277-35X; 128-744-842-259-849; 133-670-766-665-088; 151-505-335-896-742; 153-430-574-803-231; 164-824-693-072-890; 184-261-773-220-661,6

The properties of the biochars were measured, and their amelioration effects on the acidity of a red soil and environmental risk of application of sludge biochars were examined to evaluate the possibility of agricultural application of wastewater sludge biochars in red soils. Results indicated that incorporation of both sludge and sludge biochar increased soil pH due to the alkalinity of sludge and sludge biochar, and the mineralization of organic N and nitrification of ammonium N from wastewater sludge induced soil pH fluctuated during incubation. The amelioration effects of biochars generated at 500 and 700 degrees C on the soil were significantly greater than that of sludge significantly. Sludge and sludge biochar contain ample base cations of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+ and thus incorporation of sludge and sludge biochar increased the contents of soil exchangeable base cations and decreased soil exchangeable aluminum and H+. Contents of heavy metals in sludge biochars were greater than these in their feedstock sludge, while the contents of Cu, Pb, Ni and As in sludge biochars were lower than the standard values of heavy metals were wastewater sludge for agricultural use in acid soils in China except for Zn and Cd. The contents of available forms of heavy metals in the biochars generated from sludge from Chengdong wastewater treatment plant was lower than these in the corresponding sludge, suggesting that pyrolysis proceed decreased the activity of heavy metals in wastewater sludge. After 90-day incubation of the soil with sludge and sludge biochar, the differences in the contents of soil available heavy metals were not significant between the biochars and their feedstock sludge from Jiangxizhou wastewater treatment plant, and the contents in the treatments with biochars added was lower than these in the treatments with the corresponding sludge from Chengdong wastewater treatment plant for most of heavy metals. It can be concluded that the biochars from wastewater sludge could be used as soil amendments to adjust soil acidity. Application of sludge biochars did not increase activity and availability of heavy metals compared with direct incorporation of the sludge.",33,10,3585,3591,Sewage sludge treatment; Environmental chemistry; Mineralization (soil science); Soil water; Soil conditioner; Chemistry; Soil pH; Waste management; Biochar; Sewage treatment; Red soil,,"Acids/analysis; Anaerobiosis; Charcoal/chemistry; China; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Restoration and Remediation/methods; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Metals, Heavy/analysis; Sewage/chemistry; Soil Pollutants/chemistry; Waste Disposal, Fluid/methods; Waste Water/chemistry","Acids; Metals, Heavy; Sewage; Soil Pollutants; Waste Water; biochar; Charcoal",,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-HJKZ201210045.htm https://europepmc.org/article/MED/23233992 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23233992,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23233992,23233992,,2467762669,,0,,2

Pristine biochar derived from hydrothermal carbonization of individual rice husks was included as a control. FTIR, SEM and BET analyses indicated that the modified biochar is more hydrophobic and basic than the pristine biochar due to the anchoring of surface nitrogenous functionalities. The adsorption of copper ions onto the pristine and modified biochar was investigated with respect to pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, temperature, kinetics and isotherms. The results showed that modification of the biochar by nitrogen significantly increased the copper adsorption capacity from 13.12 mg g−1 for the pristine biochar to 29.11 mg g−1 for the modified biochar.

Moreover, it provides a suitable habitat for microorganisms that can reduce harmful gases. Adding biochar to a traditional landfill clay cover (i.e., biochar-amended clay cover) can increase soil porosity, improve soil air flow, and reduce landfill methane emissions which are an area of interest for many researchers. In the present research, the air permeability of biochar-clay is considered to be the main measure in evaluating the fluid-flow characteristic of the material. We discussed the influence of biochar content and particle size on air permeability of biochar-clay and its mechanism. The air permeability coefficient ka of biochar-clay mixture with different biochar content (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), dry densities (1.42 g/cm3, 1.56 g/cm3, and 1.65 g/cm3), and biochar particle size ranges ( 74 μm) were measured using a flexible wall air permeability testing device. Changes in soil pore structure were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results show that when dry density was 1.42 g/cm3, the air permeability coefficient decreased as the biochar content increased. For biochar-clay mixture of 1.56 g/cm3 and 1.65 g/cm3, when the biochar content was 15%, the air permeability coefficient of biochar-clay mixture reached its lowest value. Comparing the air permeability coefficient of biochar-clay mixture with non-intersecting particle size groups of biochar, it was revealed that the permeability coefficient decreased as the biochar particle size decreased. Based on the pore structure of biochar-clay mixture with different biochar content and particle size, the influence biochar content and particle size on the air permeability was evident.",14,8,1,12,Air permeability specific surface; Airflow; Adsorption; Specific surface area; Particle size; Materials science; Scanning electron microscope; Chemical engineering; Biochar; Porosity,,,,National Sciences Foundation of China; National Sciences Foundation of China; The Open Research Fund of Hubei Key Laboratory of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12517-021-06988-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-021-06988-6,,10.1007/s12517-021-06988-6,3155198320,,0,000-584-467-255-085; 002-438-242-821-151; 002-775-171-759-713; 007-344-779-927-911; 012-093-913-677-931; 012-658-053-219-855; 013-161-349-418-178; 020-900-559-922-348; 031-890-843-383-700; 032-248-777-496-085; 033-701-970-819-076; 033-829-663-086-442; 036-945-276-054-341; 049-015-505-797-802; 049-059-470-966-243; 049-531-292-143-16X; 055-373-419-574-861; 068-409-125-466-80X; 071-791-575-202-180; 072-328-300-112-911; 072-758-845-317-650; 074-511-081-513-376; 077-859-497-978-085; 080-251-935-004-559; 081-059-052-517-883; 081-435-433-766-214; 087-164-766-399-80X; 087-236-786-691-955; 093-747-226-584-598; 094-361-323-569-271; 095-602-475-262-405; 096-122-193-689-359; 102-199-675-978-146; 102-833-010-257-606; 115-029-426-734-01X; 141-103-633-169-696; 147-085-456-023-38X; 154-012-665-902-643; 156-624-350-873-745; 174-685-171-957-400,1

Research within ; the last decade has revealed that biochar additions to soil can affect the mineralization of ; soil organic carbon (SOC). Conversely, the ; mineralization of biochar in the environment ; has also been shown to vary with soil type, ; likely due to the effect of native SOM and ; other soil properties on the mineralization of ; biochar. It is important to recognize and ; study biochar-SOM interactions for a number of reasons. First, these interactions must ; be understood and quantifi ed so that biochar ; users or land managers can accurately predict ; future soil C stocks following biochar amendments, which is particularly important in scenarios where the C impact of biochar ; application must be properly determined for ; climate change mitigation purposes. Second,many important properties of soil depend ; upon the quantity of organic matter (OM) ; present, including fertility, water holding ; capacity and aggregation. Third, any changes ; in SOC cycling following the addition of biochar will have effects on the cycling of other ; nutrients associated with SOM, including ; nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), possibly ; altering nutrient availability to soil microbes ; or plants, nutrient leaching or gaseous emission rates.

Abit; Carl H. Bolster; Keri B. Cantrell; Jessamine Q. Flores; Sharon L. Walker,"The incorporation of biochar into soils has been proposed as a means to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. An added environmental benefit is that biochar has been shown to increase soil retention of agrochemicals, and recent research has indicated that biochar may be effective in increasing soil retention of bacteria. In this study we investigate the transport behavior of O157:H7, serovar Typhimurium, and carboxylated polystyrene microspheres in water-saturated column experiments for two soils (fine sand and sandy loam) amended with 2% poultry litter or pine chip biochars pyrolyzed at 350 and 700°C. Adding poultry litter biochar pyrolyzed at 350°C did not improve soil retention of either bacteria in fine sand and even facilitated their transport in sandy loam. Addition of either biochar pyrolyzed at 700°C generally improved retention of bacteria in fine sand, with the pine chip biochars being more effective in limiting their transport. Results from the column studies and auxiliary batch studies suggest that changes in cell retention after biochar amendments were likely due to changes in bacterial attachment in the column and not to physical straining or changes in survivability. We also found that changes in bacterial hydrophobicity after biochar amendments were generally correlated with changes in bacterial retention. The influence of biochar amendment in increasing retention of both bacteria was generally more pronounced in fine sand and indicates that soil texture affects the transport behavior of bacteria through biochar-amended soils.",43,1,371,388,Environmental chemistry; Loam; Soil water; Soil texture; Chemistry; Carbon sequestration; Poultry litter; Amendment; Pyrolysis; Biochar,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25602571 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/43/1/371 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25602571/ http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25602571/ https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2134/jeq2013.06.0236,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.06.0236,25602571,10.2134/jeq2013.06.0236,2045007601,,0,000-620-963-859-940; 001-020-299-979-027; 005-739-018-405-987; 007-181-940-744-318; 009-560-117-907-478; 010-278-051-340-494; 011-751-968-011-964; 013-488-393-402-880; 013-891-581-659-077; 015-818-626-255-909; 017-726-494-248-874; 018-008-919-730-202; 025-306-354-387-310; 026-497-911-273-975; 028-119-654-180-472; 028-817-985-963-437; 032-903-647-134-05X; 035-508-971-227-02X; 036-048-792-169-532; 037-114-460-936-634; 041-392-196-828-718; 049-317-539-308-804; 049-433-412-200-861; 057-382-397-084-892; 064-655-278-564-572; 065-281-086-727-480; 066-316-433-380-906; 068-088-653-012-890; 068-942-238-741-922; 068-944-393-652-849; 082-342-416-622-44X; 082-375-993-772-414; 084-833-288-154-715; 098-132-225-862-77X; 102-819-232-224-630; 106-693-719-816-704; 111-107-637-159-823; 122-404-117-864-633; 136-752-661-413-317; 142-858-366-194-96X; 147-524-565-368-215; 149-399-346-227-183; 151-714-568-529-936; 168-904-561-872-832; 181-908-751-607-414; 189-523-715-245-536,32

Its yield and quality vary significantly with the production technology and process parameters, which also affect its performance in agro and forestry systems. In this review, biochar production technologies including slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, gasification, and torrefaction were compared. The yield of biochar was found to decrease with faster heating rate or more oxygen available. The benefits of biochar application to agro and forestry systems were discussed. Improvements in soil health, plant growth, carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas mitigation are apparent in many cases, but opposite results do exist, indicating that the beneficial aspect of biochar are limited to particular conditions such as the type of biochar used, the rate of application, soil type, climate, and crop species. Limitations of current studies and future research needed on biochar are also discussed. Specifically, the relationships among biochar production technologies, biochar properties, and biochar performance in agro and forestry systems must be better understood.",723,,137775,137775,Soil health;

003-563-736-773-697,Biochar engineering and ageing influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil pH in the charosphere,,2021,journal article,Geoderma,00167061; 18726259,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Xuejiao Chen; Steven Lewis; Kate Heal; Qimei Lin; Saran Sohi,"Abstract The charosphere, the interface microzone between biochar and soil, plays a vital role in biochemical processes following biochar application to soil. However, the development of the charosphere over time, and the pH dynamics within and around it, remain poorly understood as biochar ages. In this study, two kinds of biochars with distinct characteristics, a pristine biochar (BCSE) and a hydroxyapatite engineered biochar (BCHA), were subjected to artificial physicochemical ageing treatment. The localized impact of the fresh and aged biochars on soil pH were quantified, and spatiotemporal changes at the microscale visualized, using the planar optode technique. Association between the biochar characteristics and their charospheres was assessed using correlation and redundancy analyses to identify controls on charosphere properties. Significant localized effects on soil pH were induced by biochar application, with pH gradients around biochar particles forming gradually over 24 h. Fresh biochars generated charospheres with radii ranging from 1.13 mm to 1.63 mm. However, ageing treatment slightly narrowed the charosphere radius to 1.08–1.12 mm. The spatiotemporal variations of pH in the charosphere were closely related to biochar characteristics. Ageing treatment resulted in large increases in the oxygen (91%–349%) and available phosphorus (670%–1094%) contents of biochar, but decreases in ash content (42%–45%), as well as pH (26%–54%) and electrical conductivity (EC) (17%–64%) values. The pore structure of biochar was altered and minerals were lost during the ageing process, so that aged biochars had much smaller specific surface area compared to the fresh biochars. Correlation and redundancy analyses revealed that the biochar EC value was the main factor determining the charosphere radius and pH within it. This study is the first to visualize and compare the charosphere derived from different fresh and aged biochars at a high resolution. The results provide new insight into the pH dynamics of the charosphere and the availability of elements as biochar ages following application to soil, which are important for understanding nutrient availability to plants and mobility of soil contaminants.",386,,114919,,Environmental chemistry; Nutrient; Specific surface area; Chemistry; Soil pH; Ageing; Phosphorus; Biochar,,,,China Scholarship Council,https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/biochar-engineering-and-ageing-influence-the-spatiotemporal-dynam https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/7231295 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Geode.386k4919C/abstract https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016706120326744,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114919,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114919,3119989392,,0,001-592-553-674-426; 006-121-331-752-960; 006-327-919-332-59X; 007-397-566-440-420; 008-174-366-641-672; 010-027-522-701-094; 010-239-794-786-604; 010-385-448-539-34X; 011-815-461-235-66X; 012-933-776-245-831; 013-550-648-417-393; 014-710-803-046-032; 017-225-524-481-760; 019-169-464-147-961; 019-414-878-456-488; 022-852-797-639-969; 023-168-310-550-766; 025-887-182-108-757; 026-069-042-011-920; 031-642-843-875-817; 032-674-060-280-174; 038-048-839-888-108; 038-922-685-419-306; 043-000-824-300-867; 043-752-573-251-387; 044-886-747-610-379; 048-116-509-887-668; 052-702-203-103-740; 053-058-106-054-870; 053-141-389-102-154; 054-898-256-348-098; 055-278-355-846-948; 056-294-319-796-02X; 057-362-471-813-46X; 059-077-178-773-905; 060-265-619-525-813; 062-710-603-262-639; 063-929-521-180-990; 065-281-086-727-480; 071-365-037-852-213; 071-400-089-018-491; 078-555-418-851-03X; 080-444-113-859-516; 083-116-756-288-717; 083-782-114-056-599; 085-066-659-585-234; 086-069-721-569-05X; 088-084-228-028-901; 097-499-398-270-048; 099-462-531-669-52X; 118-762-739-028-379; 125-122-362-084-474; 133-391-757-611-641,9
003-874-941-625-157,Effects of Biochar on Container Substrate Properties and Growth of Plants—A Review,2019-02-01,2019,journal article,Horticulturae,23117524,MDPI AG,,Lan Huang; Mengmeng Gu,"Biochar refers to a processed, carbon-rich material made from biomass. This article provides a brief summary on the effects of biochar on container substrate properties and plant growth. Biochar could be produced through pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal carbonization of various feedstocks. Biochar produced through different production conditions and feedstocks affect its properties and how it performs when incorporated in container substrates. Biochar incorporation affects the physical and chemical properties of container substrates, including bulk density, total porosity, container capacity, nutrient availability, pH, electrical conductivity and cation exchange capacity. Biochar could also affect microbial activities. The effects of biochar incorporation on plant growth in container substrates depend on biochar properties, plant type, percentage of biochar applied and other container substrates components mixed with biochar. A review of the literature on the impact of biochar on container-grown plants without other factors (such as irrigation or fertilization rates) indicated that 77.3% of the studies found that certain percentages of biochar addition in container substrates promoted plant growth, and 50% of the studies revealed that plant growth decreased due to certain percentages of biochar incorporation. Most of the plants tested in these studies were herbaceous plants. More plant species should be tested for a broader assessment of the use of biochar. Toxic substances (heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxin) in biochars used in container substrates has rarely been studied. Caution is needed when selecting feedstocks and setting up biochar production conditions, which might cause toxic contaminants in the biochar products that could have negative effects on plant growth.",5,1,14,,Contamination; Nutrient; Chemistry; Cation-exchange capacity; Biomass; Hydrothermal carbonization; Pyrolysis; Pulp and paper industry; Biochar; Bulk density,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/5/1/14 https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/5/1/14/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae5010014,,10.3390/horticulturae5010014,2911442964,,0,000-564-935-809-280; 000-753-056-529-322; 002-021-190-784-227; 002-906-234-958-494; 003-224-455-136-708; 004-190-788-924-060; 005-039-203-336-824; 005-703-692-788-946; 005-877-404-331-213; 008-601-115-727-344; 009-529-433-564-563; 009-632-667-910-137; 011-298-420-957-938; 011-344-978-865-906; 011-358-046-415-291; 011-574-316-336-056; 012-213-914-370-468; 012-990-554-436-799; 013-019-996-884-311; 013-049-651-724-088; 014-284-745-551-946; 014-908-123-717-625; 014-931-517-175-14X; 015-989-981-235-984; 017-782-606-208-84X; 018-187-542-275-989; 018-899-506-522-634; 022-638-759-288-603; 023-181-059-816-072; 026-838-133-417-76X; 027-190-200-224-114; 028-829-712-355-776; 029-904-428-110-185; 030-920-437-462-92X; 033-049-505-174-132; 036-522-792-437-512; 036-738-955-814-064; 037-101-222-625-299; 039-262-966-265-046; 042-153-319-267-614; 042-938-141-412-510; 043-826-155-696-921; 045-255-904-819-084; 045-779-440-470-175; 047-322-274-693-519; 051-737-250-166-385; 052-244-542-031-66X; 055-260-752-280-508; 055-796-951-753-027; 059-447-392-260-508; 059-838-334-010-322; 061-775-345-470-03X; 065-281-086-727-480; 067-254-741-417-737; 067-500-072-090-028; 068-124-717-664-405; 068-156-124-480-332; 070-882-600-361-675; 072-471-186-605-158; 073-094-662-065-240; 080-387-489-093-573; 081-200-948-841-870; 081-568-563-557-831; 081-965-203-455-443; 082-561-998-798-583; 093-947-845-856-421; 094-556-831-233-838; 094-777-574-860-804; 095-269-109-799-337; 095-803-747-247-024; 103-989-639-999-217; 109-694-046-310-381; 110-044-277-791-881; 111-171-151-000-464; 112-238-226-936-591; 114-682-980-471-03X; 116-644-346-944-798; 131-134-966-044-786; 134-303-713-290-886; 134-759-254-662-323; 139-639-515-004-077; 142-188-438-328-200; 144-108-180-046-774; 145-976-969-346-05X; 149-665-527-932-147; 153-384-639-873-413; 175-307-140-482-121; 181-796-998-020-232; 184-462-136-906-231; 189-312-440-837-363; 189-739-638-300-863,35

Masiello; Helge M. Gonnermann,"Many studies report that, under some circumstances, amending soil with biochar can improve field capacity and plant-available water. However, little is known about the mechanisms that control these improvements, making it challenging to predict when biochar will improve soil water properties. To develop a conceptual model explaining biochar's effects on soil hydrologic processes, we conducted a series of well constrained laboratory experiments using a sand matrix to test the effects of biochar particle size and porosity on soil water retention curves. We showed that biochar particle size affects soil water storage through changing pore space between particles (interpores) and by adding pores that are part of the biochar (intrapores). We used these experimental results to better understand how biochar intrapores and biochar particle shape control the observed changes in water retention when capillary pressure is the main component of soil water potential. We propose that biochar's intrapores increase water content of biochar-sand mixtures when soils are drier. When biochar-sand mixtures are wetter, biochar particles' elongated shape disrupts the packing of grains in the sandy matrix, increasing the volume between grains (interpores) available for water storage. These results imply that biochars with a high intraporosity and irregular shapes will most effectively increase water storage in coarse soils.",12,6,e0179079,,Agricultural soil science; Soil science; Soil water; Mineralogy; Water content; Field capacity; Soil chemistry; Water potential; Environmental science; Biochar; Porosity,,"Charcoal/chemistry; Models, Theoretical; Particle Size; Porosity; Soil/chemistry; Water",Soil; biochar; Water; Charcoal,National Science Foundation,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PLoSO..1279079L/abstract http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179079 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28598988/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598988 https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/96580 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28598988 https://core.ac.uk/display/89834172 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5466324 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179079 https://paperity.org/p/80377170/biochar-particle-size-shape-and-porosity-act-together-to-influence-soil-water-properties https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20173264228 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179079 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/89834172.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179079,28598988,10.1371/journal.pone.0179079,2624057787,PMC5466324,0,001-108-501-446-168; 001-161-720-599-802; 004-764-024-806-240; 005-920-948-966-242; 007-377-208-649-699; 007-414-469-434-872; 008-292-995-907-514; 010-531-942-576-755; 011-788-424-387-604; 012-360-057-394-042; 015-433-658-160-202; 017-553-492-527-973; 019-576-413-354-205; 022-445-339-768-677; 022-710-227-296-251; 024-799-445-028-403; 026-133-648-801-808; 030-824-853-153-077; 032-248-777-496-085; 033-022-207-067-806; 036-945-276-054-341; 049-741-591-071-835; 053-602-464-183-791; 054-691-050-368-941; 054-883-518-101-06X; 058-257-607-146-451; 058-761-436-938-106; 061-208-429-865-548; 062-696-090-399-120; 065-080-064-872-803; 070-226-530-048-513; 072-644-808-450-860; 086-399-066-845-450; 087-108-726-270-618; 091-447-044-003-038; 095-942-339-311-867; 100-571-565-894-908; 104-325-186-200-891; 122-970-377-379-77X; 123-710-738-603-411; 126-247-684-621-506; 131-134-966-044-786; 131-875-287-386-90X; 140-076-878-272-862; 145-022-193-992-355; 145-128-340-424-266; 149-399-346-227-183; 151-714-568-529-936; 181-888-729-829-146; 183-744-573-637-382; 189-523-715-245-536,155

Its productivity relies on feedstock type and thermochemical conditions of production. Biochar has many application advantages in several fields and has been widely studied in recent years. However, most of these studies are mainly on the powder form of biochar, while its pelleted form is sparsely reported. Even with the reported studies on biochar pellets, there is still lack of knowledge and awareness of the effects of different feedstock on the densification behavior of biochar. The mechanisms of biochar densification, which appear to be sensitive to the conditions predominating during its thermochemical production, are affected by the material from which the biochar is derived. This partly accounts for why biochar pellets have not been widely adopted in various application fields. Therefore, this paper presents an overview of the benefits associated with the use of biochar pellets and discusses the challenges encountered when pelleting biochars that are derived from different feedstock under various carbonization conditions. Research priority areas needed to overcome the challenges are also identified and discussed. The purpose is to contribute to better understanding on biochar pelletization behavior, and to offer insights useful to comprehend some basic principles that may occur in the pelleting process and to ease further and more thorough investigations.",9,9,1591,,Carbonization; Raw material; Paper mill; Pellets; Sewage sludge; Lack of knowledge; Environmental science; Pelletizing; Waste management; Biochar,,,,ÅForsk,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/9/9/1591 https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/9/9/1591/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr9091591,,10.3390/pr9091591,3197068975,,0,003-511-152-659-239; 003-805-893-783-476; 005-616-760-081-577; 008-521-465-945-798; 008-675-954-797-900; 009-830-067-604-862; 010-609-773-931-695; 011-813-596-355-723; 013-045-657-294-930; 014-000-284-458-126; 015-558-752-202-762; 017-754-134-550-680; 019-650-330-850-37X; 020-796-650-449-195; 027-399-692-550-879; 030-405-909-511-181; 038-621-485-687-841; 041-957-157-927-460; 043-781-100-209-077; 052-314-641-026-795; 062-126-731-429-234; 064-063-859-227-022; 065-703-615-953-107; 066-039-533-770-44X; 067-136-828-172-093; 068-670-174-608-519; 073-894-860-984-542; 075-272-931-496-500; 077-213-788-477-130; 083-005-660-513-893; 086-818-215-508-954; 092-005-914-683-515; 094-325-904-546-870; 096-696-673-256-344; 098-929-247-917-08X; 108-083-411-963-681; 111-220-234-869-809; 111-578-108-001-079; 117-317-268-027-609; 120-214-607-738-066; 121-761-987-463-947; 125-574-364-940-243; 127-107-442-564-432; 128-320-938-615-175; 132-018-686-072-238; 135-064-026-134-559; 136-930-901-457-810; 142-431-565-357-044; 143-366-992-722-841; 144-460-938-819-244; 159-361-685-076-948; 179-585-887-941-387; 190-799-975-901-168,2

D. Zhelezova; Harald Cederlund; John Stenström,"Biochar amendment can alter soil properties, for instance, the ability to adsorb and degrade different chemicals. However, ageing of the biochar, due to processes occurring in the soil over time, can influence such biochar-mediated effects. This study examined how biochar affected adsorption and degradation of two herbicides, glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine) and diuron (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) in soil and how these effects were modulated by ageing of the biochar. One sandy and one clayey soil that had been freshly amended with a wood-based biochar (0, 1, 10, 20 and 30% w/w) were studied. An ageing experiment, in which the soil-biochar mixtures were aged for 3.5 months in the laboratory, was also performed. Adsorption and degradation were studied in these soil and soil-biochar mixtures, and compared to results from a soil historically enriched with charcoal. Biochar amendment increased the pH in both soils and increased the water-holding capacity of the sandy soil. Adsorption of diuron was enhanced by biochar amendment in both soils, while glyphosate adsorption was decreased in the sandy soil. Ageing of soil-biochar mixtures decreased adsorption of both herbicides in comparison with freshly biochar-amended soil. Herbicide degradation rates were not consistently affected by biochar amendment or ageing in any of the soils. However, glyphosate half-lives correlated with the Freundlich Kf values in the clayey soil, indicating that degradation was limited by availability there.",228,6,216,216,Freundlich equation; Adsorption; Soil water; Pesticide; Chemistry; Amendment; Glyphosate; Charcoal; Biochar; Agronomy,Adsorption; Biochar; Biochar ageing; Diuron; Glyphosate; Herbicide degradation,,,Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas (SE); Erasmus Mundus,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11270-017-3392-7.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5443863/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017WASP..228..216Z/abstract https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11270-017-3392-7 https://paperity.org/p/79724069/effect-of-biochar-amendment-and-ageing-on-adsorption-and-degradation-of-two-herbicides https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11270-017-3392-7 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28603318 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20173219983 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11270-017-3392-7/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3392-7,28603318,10.1007/s11270-017-3392-7,2618465058,PMC5443863,0,000-049-694-414-176; 001-161-720-599-802; 002-112-386-894-78X; 003-273-955-910-65X; 009-984-153-778-801; 010-471-742-190-880; 010-938-192-820-185; 013-314-696-123-07X; 015-737-618-256-237; 016-164-478-595-085; 017-480-453-670-73X; 017-879-554-818-312; 018-717-255-299-609; 019-576-413-354-205; 022-811-822-344-046; 023-341-514-331-465; 023-820-889-770-497; 024-726-044-102-943; 031-148-064-519-406; 033-829-663-086-442; 034-010-237-534-469; 035-368-118-608-608; 037-301-046-232-838; 041-078-004-486-149; 046-910-288-014-286; 048-782-790-526-825; 049-289-240-482-909; 050-034-035-930-726; 052-272-146-750-740; 052-595-984-911-749; 055-531-423-732-333; 057-003-911-808-61X; 062-461-958-031-595; 062-710-603-262-639; 067-779-081-632-221; 073-042-758-822-109; 081-300-711-676-983; 087-105-366-319-09X; 090-133-259-151-881; 108-848-538-643-708; 115-713-346-737-035; 137-933-705-001-429; 141-965-179-194-646; 154-086-728-534-342; 163-693-684-972-092,37

CIP is important class of emerging water pollutants from pharmaceutical industries. The biochar showed 65% adsorption efficiency and 43.48 mg/g adsorption capacity of CIP. Adsorption efficiency as well as adsorption capacity were improved to 91% and 62.50 mg/g, respectively, by phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) modified biochar. Removal of CIP by the prepared biochar was due to different surface functional groups of CIP and biochar as revealed from the study of different characterization analyses. The presence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> group in modified biochar led to maximum binding of CIP. Also, the modified biochar showed higher reusability potential and less leaching of ions when compared to the raw biochar. Removal of CIP was affected by concentrations of CIP, the amount of biochar and different pH's; the maximum removal of CIP was achieved at pH 4. The Freundlich and <i>pseudo-first-order</i> models best fitted the removal of CIP by modified biochar. Advanced characterization techniques were applied to investigate surface and physiological characteristics of the biochar and modified biochar. The modification showed high impact on the performance and stability of biochar.

Part. B, Pesticides, food contaminants, and agricultural wastes",15324109; 03601234,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,United States,Suman Manna; Neera Singh,"The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of wheat and rice biochars on pyrazosulfuron-ethyl sorption in a sandy loam soil. Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl was poorly sorbed in the soil (3.5-8.6%) but biochar amendment increased the herbicide adsorption, and the effect varied with the nature of the feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. Biochars prepared at 600°C were more effective in adsorbing pyrazosulfuron-ethyl than biochars prepared at 400°C. Rice biochars were better than wheat biochars, and higher herbicide adsorption was attributed to the biochar surface area/porosity. The Freundlich constant 1/n suggested nonlinear isotherms, and nonlinearlity increased with increase in the level of biochar amendment. Desorption results suggested sorption of pyrazosulfuron-ethyl was partially irreversible, and the irreversibility increased with increase in the level of biochar. Both sorption and desorption of pyrazosulfuron-ethyl correlated well with the content of biochars. The free energy change (ΔG) indicated that the pyrazosulfuron-ethyl sorption process was exothermic, spontaneous and physical in nature. Persistence studies indicated that biochar (0.5%) amendment did not have significant effect on herbicide degradation, and its half-life values in the control, 0.5% WBC600- and RBC600-amended rice planted soils were 7, 8.6, and 10.4 days, respectively.",50,7,463,472,Freundlich equation; Loam; Adsorption; Soil classification; Desorption; Chemistry; Amendment; Biochar; Sorption; Agronomy,Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl; adsorption; desorption; persistence; wheat and rice straw biochars,Adsorption; Charcoal/chemistry; Environmental Restoration and Remediation/methods; Half-Life; Herbicides/chemistry; Oryza/chemistry; Pyrazoles/chemistry; Pyrimidines/chemistry; Soil/chemistry; Soil Pollutants/chemistry; Temperature; Triticum/chemistry,"Herbicides; Pyrazoles; Pyrimidines; Soil; Soil Pollutants; biochar; Charcoal; ethyl 5-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-ylcarbamoylsulfamoyl)-1-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylate",,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153199239 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25996810 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25996810/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03601234.2015.1018757,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2015.1018757,25996810,10.1080/03601234.2015.1018757,1524645096,,0,003-119-546-789-11X; 003-273-955-910-65X; 003-572-797-886-980; 003-942-726-047-325; 010-938-192-820-185; 015-440-370-376-86X; 023-447-093-741-815; 031-542-298-609-59X; 040-755-312-294-826; 049-433-412-200-861; 056-600-297-840-095; 056-871-768-733-128; 073-434-008-546-611; 075-362-093-382-924; 075-989-706-768-950; 081-466-032-643-119; 083-037-024-633-233; 086-718-493-763-148; 094-988-083-442-034; 095-942-339-311-867; 098-522-057-782-845; 108-848-538-643-708; 109-694-046-310-381; 111-468-290-239-552; 113-047-687-789-410; 116-323-077-694-163; 121-811-412-873-104; 125-766-922-988-230; 141-744-420-389-521; 151-961-213-921-398,22

Biochar, synthesized using various biomasses, showed a porous structure and a high surface area and includes embedded carbonate minerals. Compared with granular activated carbon, biochar was competitive as a sorbent for removing Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn from water according to the maximum sorption capacities of the metals. Some biochars also effectively sorbed nitro explosives from water. Correlation analysis between maximum sorption capacities and properties of biochar showed that the sorption capacity of biochar for cationic toxic metals is related to cation exchange capacity and that the sorption capacity of explosives is proportional to surface area and carbon content. Results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses and laboratory experiments suggest that surface functional groups may be responsible for the sorption of cationic metals to the biochar surface. In contrast, carbon contents may account for the sorption of explosives, possibly through π-π electron donor-acceptor interactions. Our results suggest that biochar can be an attractive and alternative option in environmental remediation of nitro explosives and metals through sorption and immobilization and that appropriate selection of biochar may be necessary according to the types of contaminant and the properties of biochar.",43,5,1663,1671,Environmental chemistry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Chemistry; Cation-exchange capacity; Sorbent; Nitro; Carbon; Environmental remediation; Biochar; Sorption,,,,Basic Science Research Program; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education,https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/43/5/1663 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25603252 https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2014.02.0097,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2014.02.0097,25603252,10.2134/jeq2014.02.0097,1973268346,,0,003-563-887-220-416; 004-131-874-940-083; 008-068-320-957-947; 012-078-978-268-279; 023-757-334-321-795; 025-306-354-387-310; 028-228-451-908-016; 029-823-503-779-520; 029-959-782-010-126; 030-074-972-052-834; 031-982-827-014-225; 032-229-079-142-497; 037-301-046-232-838; 041-203-894-774-192; 044-565-223-280-64X; 044-864-224-442-778; 049-683-389-741-206; 053-418-264-999-999; 056-686-568-682-181; 060-457-082-527-961; 066-688-856-005-195; 068-944-393-652-849; 072-624-181-387-571; 082-106-266-998-892; 093-057-578-844-236; 097-736-854-061-108; 099-704-105-005-412; 101-649-118-457-718; 102-114-420-279-911; 103-055-933-340-035; 110-084-115-020-677; 138-386-095-844-387; 140-377-816-103-392; 140-591-426-583-092; 152-339-043-964-534; 172-319-296-493-424,19

Biochars were characterized by multiple instrumental techniques and were applied to remove Cd from aqueous solution. The removal mechanism was explored, and the quantitative information regarding the relative contribution of related mechanisms to Cd sorption on biochars was provided. The results showed that pseudo-second-order kinetic model, TC (two-compartment) model, and Freundlich isotherm could well fit the process of Cd sorption on biochars. The sorption could be divided into fast and slow adsorption stages. The order of the Cd removal capacity by biochar was WSBC700 > WSBC500 > WSBC300. Adsorption amount of Cd by biochar reduced when the biochar was rinsed with 1.0 M HCl, which indicated that acid-soluble minerals in biochar played an important role during the Cd removal process, especially for the biochar obtained at high pyrolytic temperature. Various equipments were used to investigate the interaction mechanism between biochar and Cd. Mineral precipitation, surface complexation, and cation-π interaction were the main mechanisms of Cd sorption on the biochars. The contribution of cation-π mechanism was in the range of 25.42–48.58%, 2.18–19.30% for surface complexation and 32.12–72.41% for mineral precipitation, respectively. The pyrolytic temperature significantly influenced the removal capacity and mechanism of Cd on biochars. The cation-π mechanism was predominant for biochar obtained at lower pyrolytic temperature.

Corn straw and poplar leaf biochars were gained by pyrolysing the raw materials slowly in a furnace at 300, 500, and 700 °C under oxygen-deficient conditions. Scanning electron microscope was applied to observe the surface morphology of the biochars. High temperatures destroyed the pore structures of the biochars, forming a particle mixture of varying sizes. The ash content, yield, pH, and surface area were also observed to describe the biochars’ properties. The yield decreases as the pyrolysis temperature increases. The biochars are neutral to alkaline. The biggest surface area is 251.11 m2/g for 700 °C corn straw biochar. Elemental analysis, infrared microspectroscopy, solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) were also used to study the structural characteristics and build the 2D structural models of biochars. The C content in the corn straw and poplar leaf biochars increases with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature. A higher pyrolysis temperature makes the aryl carbon increase, and C=O, OH, and aliphatic hydrocarbon content decrease in the IR spectra. Solid-state C-13 NMR spectra show that a higher pyrolysis temperature makes the alkyl carbon and alkoxy carbon decrease and the aryl carbon increase. The results of IR microspectra and solid-state C-13 NMR spectra reveal that some noticeable differences exist in these two kinds of biochars and in the same type of biochar but under different pyrolysis temperatures. The conceptual elemental compositions of 500 °C corn straw and poplar leaf biochars are C61H33NO13 and C59H41N3O12, respectively. Significant differences exist in the SEM images, physicochemical properties, and structural characteristics of corn straw and poplar leaf biochars.",25,26,25789,25798,Chemistry; Raw material; Straw; Alkyl; Pyrolysis; Chemical engineering; Carbon; Charcoal; Biochar; Elemental analysis,2D structural modelings; Biochar characteristics; Corn straw; Poplar leaf; Pyrolysis temperature,"Carbon; Charcoal/chemistry; Hot Temperature; Plant Leaves/chemistry; Plant Stems/chemistry; Populus; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Temperature; Zea mays",biochar; Charcoal; Carbon,National Natural Science Foundation of China (41271331); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2016M591267),https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29270898 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-017-0959-1/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-017-0959-1 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29270898/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270898 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193358655,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0959-1,29270898,10.1007/s11356-017-0959-1,2780622311,,0,001-506-770-698-594; 001-850-855-482-410; 002-175-489-923-553; 002-220-793-918-636; 008-068-320-957-947; 010-103-660-729-812; 010-344-115-563-383; 011-428-993-326-669; 012-078-978-268-279; 013-019-996-884-311; 013-265-373-706-096; 018-951-716-448-992; 024-282-338-548-292; 027-976-998-585-676; 028-217-006-893-828; 028-269-570-424-824; 028-965-446-292-691; 030-074-972-052-834; 030-569-785-053-609; 035-242-581-769-178; 038-757-502-967-726; 039-295-271-706-125; 042-833-240-929-696; 045-325-125-118-597; 051-148-290-236-59X; 060-457-082-527-961; 066-688-856-005-195; 075-272-931-496-500; 076-915-844-855-715; 081-936-390-131-088; 082-836-894-761-41X; 084-393-424-085-413; 096-950-597-800-600; 097-344-898-048-180; 105-575-319-798-822; 106-171-415-397-290; 116-140-673-532-927; 121-434-157-094-574; 132-923-307-619-118; 160-552-824-931-658; 176-895-639-241-503,7

We explored imaging techniques to visualize and quantify fungal colonization of habitable spaces in a biochar made from a woody feedstock. In addition to characterization of the biochar, it was necessary to optimize preparation and observation methodologies for examining fungal colonization of the biochar. Biochar surfaces and pores were investigated using several microscopy techniques. Biochar particles were compared in soilless media and after deposition in soil. Scanning electron microscopy(SEM) observations and characterization of the biochar demonstrated structural heterogeneity within and among biochar particles. Fungal colonization in and on biochar particles was observed using light, fluorescence and electron microscopy. Fluorescent brightener RR 2200 was more effective than Calcofluor White as a hyphal stain. Biochar retrieved from soil and observed using fluorescence microscopy exhibited distinct hyphal networks on external biochar surfaces. The extent of hyphal colonization of biochar incubated in soil was much less than for biochar artificially inoculated with fungi in a soilless medium. The location of fungal hyphae was more clearly visible using SEM than with fluorescence microscopy. Observations of biochar particles colonized by hyphae from soil posed a range of difficulties including obstruction by the presence of soil particles on biochar surfaces and inside pores. Extensive hyphal colonization of the surface of the biochar in the soilless medium contrasted with limited hyphal colonization of pores within the biochar. Both visualization and quantification of hyphal colonization of surfaces and pores of biochar were restricted by two-dimensional imaging associated with uneven biochar surfaces and variable biochar pore structure. There was very little colonization of biochar from hyphae in the agricultural soil used in this study.",,3,483,490,Environmental chemistry; Microscopy; Microorganism; Chemistry; Colonization; Calcofluor-white; Fungal hyphae; Fungal colonization; Biochar; Hypha,,,,,http://www.cqvip.com/QK/86610A/201403/49297420.html,http://www.cqvip.com/QK/86610A/201403/49297420.html,,,3148575909,,0,,59

Almond soft husk and rice husk biochars as precursor reagents were applied to prepare the modified biochars with abundant amino groups for heavy metal removal. For this purpose, biochars included levels zero (without biochar or control) and 4 wt% (unmodified biochar and modified biochar). Biochars were modified separately with Fe3O4, NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, and HNO3 and four levels of potassium dichromate (0–150 mg/kg soil) were used. Sampling from the treated soil was carried out 5 months after the contamination of soil with chromium. All treatments (5 g) were extracted with 25 mL of a 0.01 M EDTA solutions. The suspensions were shaken for different time periods (5 to 2880 min) at 150 rpm. Concentration of Cr was analyzed in each extract by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results indicated that adding rice husk and almond soft husk biochars to the soil resulted in a decrease in Cr uptake at all extraction times compared to control, whereas the rice husk biochar showed a lower reduction in Cr removal than the control compared to the almond soft husk biochar. Based on the determination coefficient and standard error, the best two-constant rate equations are considered the best predictor of the chromium release kinetics trend in the studied soil.",14,1,1,17,Calcareous; Nuclear chemistry; Chemistry; Potassium dichromate; Hexavalent chromium; Atomic absorption spectroscopy; Extraction (chemistry); Chromium; Biochar; Husk,,,,,https://www.scilit.net/article/1ca8c5ec09765a53ee8a4e21a9db95aa https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12517-020-06269-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-020-06269-8,,10.1007/s12517-020-06269-8,3120026011,,0,002-152-835-912-493; 003-549-314-320-056; 005-104-202-495-012; 005-156-591-976-630; 007-824-971-125-540; 012-696-352-346-19X; 015-497-737-514-593; 016-164-478-595-085; 016-275-608-893-614; 018-542-377-873-152; 018-719-347-017-698; 019-624-182-820-427; 020-455-103-184-102; 020-466-926-940-937; 023-912-435-498-212; 024-475-728-399-107; 028-689-518-321-052; 029-573-976-161-30X; 030-694-007-794-964; 031-912-243-316-250; 033-430-881-852-198; 033-740-066-210-117; 034-588-855-658-419; 034-957-847-338-002; 035-081-457-672-534; 037-443-684-955-612; 039-802-084-973-66X; 047-795-828-232-619; 049-210-907-648-758; 050-601-277-422-781; 053-879-412-978-56X; 061-007-999-220-61X; 061-379-540-776-89X; 062-126-731-429-234; 077-129-148-016-65X; 084-082-294-261-619; 085-613-827-366-138; 092-908-576-882-892; 095-093-825-623-096; 096-516-022-509-212; 102-392-430-275-658; 114-541-024-137-411; 133-293-002-714-125; 152-936-129-762-517; 172-905-830-860-231; 174-670-828-069-095; 182-170-799-508-261,1

Compared with rice straw (RS) biochar synthesized in a laboratory, the sorption capacities of WC and BC biochars are determined by the types of contaminants, the properties of the biochar, and sorption mechanisms. BS and WC biochars are competitive as sorbents for nitro explosives and chlorinated phenols. Characterization of biochar-mortar composites showed that 3-5 wt% biochar inclusion did not significantly change the composites&apos; engineering properties, including flowability, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity. As the biochar content increased in the biochar-mortar composites, the benzene and toluene concentrations in air were accordingly reduced, suggesting that biochar inclusion may be favorable to remove volatile toxic contaminants that cause sick building syndrome. The toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP) and Micotox (R) bioassay tests showed that biochar-mortar composites were not toxic.

Gaskin; Miguel L. Cabrera; William P. Miller; Keshav C. Das,"Biochar can potentially increase soil fertility and sequester carbon by incorporating nutrients and stable black carbon into the soil; however its effect on soil nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) processes is not well understood. A defined methodology to characterize biochar is necessary to predict how specific biochars will affect C and N mineralization. We amended a Tifton soil (Fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Plinthic Kandiudults) with peanut hull (Arachis hypogaea; PH; 2.1% N) and pine chip (Pinus taeda; PC: 0.4% N) biochar at application rates of 1% and 2% (w/w) and performed a 136-day mineralization study. A companion 24-day mineralization study amended Tifton soil with PH and PC biochar at 2% and their respective feedstocks at equal C rates. Soil C mineralization rates were monitored periodically throughout each study and total N mineralization rates were also measured. In addition, we characterized each biochar using thermogravimetric analysis with mass spectrometer (TGA-MS), proximate analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and total mineral analysis to identify biochar characteristics that might correlate with mineralization properties. Limited C (<2%) mineralized from both biochars, but mineralization rates of soil amended with PH biochar were higher than PC biochar. Carbon mineralization correlated well with estimated aliphatic content determined by TGA-MS but not with volatile content indicated by proximate analysis. Nitrogen was not mineralized from either biochar, indicating that plant-based biochar should not be considered a source of N for plant growth. The N in biochar may be contained in the stable aromatic structure of the biochar, as indicated by TGA-MS, and not available to soil microbes.",3,2,294,312,Mineralization (soil science); Nutrient; Chemistry; Carbon sequestration; Tifton; Soil fertility; Nitrogen cycle; Nitrogen; Biochar; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/3/2/294 http://athenaeum.libs.uga.edu/handle/10724/27151 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6468897 https://doaj.org/article/3710f51b67db4902ae2922bb5bd4bc27 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/3/2/294/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy3020294,,10.3390/agronomy3020294,1972665639,,0,000-589-838-797-960; 000-593-210-331-016; 001-298-202-769-979; 002-176-140-520-190; 002-728-226-076-038; 003-825-243-170-06X; 004-579-405-730-759; 007-634-685-452-834; 009-006-569-024-117; 012-620-519-591-12X; 019-330-245-299-146; 022-445-339-768-677; 023-318-880-763-027; 023-340-481-599-937; 024-254-347-289-853; 028-292-501-684-513; 028-656-050-935-057; 030-085-678-415-511; 030-534-360-426-297; 034-010-237-534-469; 034-196-641-125-374; 035-236-159-748-979; 044-565-223-280-64X; 049-038-217-643-472; 049-770-657-481-187; 057-562-865-464-30X; 058-835-522-762-492; 061-322-609-324-780; 061-728-097-587-658; 062-583-733-253-715; 062-710-603-262-639; 071-480-400-593-951; 072-648-097-064-629; 075-215-444-557-504; 081-234-698-615-63X; 085-849-478-302-240; 087-181-820-632-823; 088-353-707-727-454; 090-022-407-059-154; 090-283-731-851-851; 095-942-339-311-867; 099-990-550-161-771; 111-083-347-741-926; 112-497-974-413-936; 131-952-294-006-035; 132-723-143-258-195; 145-329-955-733-736; 146-187-334-310-496,27

Biochar is used as a soil amendment to repair soil. Therefore, research on biochar has received extensive attention. According to relevant literature reports, biochar has strong adsorption performance, and according to its nature, it can improve the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus in crops and fix nitrogen and phosphorus in soil. Also, biochar can also improve soil structure and reduce the migration of N and P with soil media. The research mechanism of biochar is distinct. The article cites the results of the majority of researchers and explains the effects of different biochars. Biochar has a certain promoting effect on nitrogen, phosphorus adsorption, conversion and leaching. In the future, we should strengthen the prospect of biochar in the treatment of soil environment and sustainable development of the environment.</jats:p>",424,1,012015,,Environmental chemistry; Chemistry; Soil nitrogen; Phosphorus; Biochar,,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/424/1/012015 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020E&ES..424a2015H/abstract https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/424/1/012015/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/424/1/012015,,10.1088/1755-1315/424/1/012015,3003403720,,0,002-175-489-923-553; 002-429-462-374-563; 009-111-041-930-466; 009-281-512-467-159; 010-909-102-480-867; 014-245-111-657-798; 015-323-340-164-679; 015-961-075-985-447; 016-530-317-575-523; 017-219-177-972-563; 017-957-732-746-982; 017-960-890-741-99X; 018-399-638-935-595; 019-677-999-932-545; 024-282-338-548-292; 024-387-946-516-957; 027-941-096-090-623; 028-803-267-849-050; 031-262-794-838-854; 034-010-237-534-469; 034-422-417-129-074; 035-248-802-924-512; 036-419-058-463-913; 043-373-724-279-011; 044-565-223-280-64X; 047-468-640-176-274; 050-283-970-283-379; 051-735-902-040-333; 053-141-389-102-154; 053-498-910-633-573; 054-142-761-552-436; 057-831-118-803-657; 062-646-668-137-843; 067-094-174-463-883; 070-034-864-592-15X; 070-252-477-451-74X; 074-853-480-050-620; 079-443-096-095-517; 089-820-369-636-563; 094-556-831-233-838; 096-516-022-509-212; 096-671-853-872-565; 101-847-670-759-522; 104-919-625-897-925; 111-699-904-875-35X; 114-251-514-615-329; 114-445-831-162-365; 119-747-570-955-185; 125-161-555-977-705; 127-771-950-398-421; 140-602-755-147-559; 141-790-873-459-243; 144-460-938-819-244; 151-261-314-771-977; 155-062-517-633-199; 155-078-713-837-566; 166-260-799-590-938; 195-171-226-962-666,2

Thomas,"A number of processes for post-production treatment of “raw” biochars, including leaching, aeration, grinding or sieving to reduce particle size, and chemical or steam activation, have been suggested as means to enhance biochar effectiveness in agriculture, forestry, and environmental restoration. Here, I review studies on post-production processing methods and their effects on biochar physio-chemical properties and present a meta-analysis of plant growth and yield responses to post-processed vs. “raw” biochars. Data from 23 studies provide a total of 112 comparisons of responses to processed vs. unprocessed biochars, and 103 comparisons allowing assessment of effects relative to biochar particle size; additional 8 published studies involving 32 comparisons provide data on effects of biochar leachates. Overall, post-processed biochars resulted in significantly increased average plant growth responses 14% above those observed with unprocessed biochar. This overall effect was driven by plant growth responses to reduced biochar particle size, and heating/aeration treatments. The assessment of biochar effects by particle size indicates a peak at a particle size of 0.5–1.0 mm. Biochar leachate treatments showed very high heterogeneity among studies and no average growth benefit. I conclude that physiochemical post-processing of biochar offers substantial additional agronomic benefits compared to the use of unprocessed biochar. Further research on post-production treatments effects will be important for biochar utilization to maximize benefits to carbon sequestration and system productivity in agriculture, forestry, and environmental restoration.",3,4,437,455,Leaching (agriculture); Leachate; Particle size; Carbon sequestration; Plant growth; Environmental science; Pelletizing; Pulp and paper industry; Biochar; Aeration,Activation; Granulation; Leachates; Particle size; Pelletization; Post-processing,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42773-021-00115-0.pdf https://dc.engconfintl.org/biochar_ii/34/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42773-021-00115-0 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8547209,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42773-021-00115-0,34723131,10.1007/s42773-021-00115-0,2990298940,PMC8547209,0,001-340-605-027-108; 001-426-571-337-796; 002-201-960-533-589; 002-226-859-444-320; 003-186-143-304-843; 003-895-742-038-403; 003-905-809-818-882; 003-977-793-657-06X; 004-122-717-710-108; 004-205-035-305-942; 004-879-644-437-36X; 005-853-720-899-082; 005-975-662-309-739; 006-121-331-752-960; 006-407-025-454-547; 007-344-779-927-911; 007-721-264-857-361; 007-841-118-017-088; 008-245-822-029-459; 008-799-444-339-47X; 009-801-931-535-028; 010-245-298-640-586; 010-370-114-618-329; 011-037-220-288-949; 011-364-663-695-365; 011-935-036-278-841; 012-791-997-545-204; 012-990-554-436-799; 013-416-742-951-608; 013-574-100-214-650; 014-031-073-544-034; 014-392-966-692-249; 015-972-680-531-973; 015-989-981-235-984; 017-048-387-605-813; 017-225-524-481-760; 017-271-666-731-128; 017-307-907-033-737; 017-487-483-764-499; 017-557-167-542-166; 017-574-987-826-310; 017-843-626-412-553; 018-841-612-360-518; 018-911-070-949-248; 020-314-251-279-673; 021-189-752-305-83X; 021-756-790-773-309; 022-249-915-504-146; 022-638-603-172-68X; 022-710-227-296-251; 023-719-986-160-563; 023-820-889-770-497; 024-226-926-146-090; 024-347-291-014-748; 024-524-012-030-492; 024-689-265-004-044; 025-711-125-315-558; 025-887-182-108-757; 026-381-108-873-491; 026-749-038-036-403; 026-851-177-238-161; 026-964-543-996-562; 027-192-482-375-883; 027-255-237-612-502; 028-450-893-192-497; 028-747-471-307-925; 030-085-678-415-511; 030-765-333-365-36X; 030-948-294-904-050; 031-500-808-473-632; 032-815-024-402-919; 033-120-518-980-044; 033-306-341-006-478; 033-829-663-086-442; 034-010-237-534-469; 034-127-512-970-919; 034-188-507-197-086; 034-333-289-893-320; 036-434-097-873-099; 036-469-163-300-046; 037-294-370-153-338; 041-533-917-963-183; 041-537-158-178-149; 043-752-573-251-387; 043-868-467-521-130; 043-919-765-221-416; 044-089-105-555-345; 045-763-793-417-429; 046-020-256-904-183; 046-249-374-128-643; 046-622-430-054-929; 046-910-288-014-286; 050-417-438-245-043; 050-781-751-606-168; 051-405-060-936-755; 052-240-190-743-947; 052-303-682-249-529; 052-901-644-265-851; 053-293-767-257-157; 053-621-554-813-623; 055-346-964-767-032; 055-433-876-138-143; 055-856-979-703-728; 059-310-323-839-64X; 059-444-678-907-801; 060-238-123-925-73X; 061-322-609-324-780; 064-194-569-614-198; 064-733-717-886-428; 068-510-913-554-508; 068-781-169-459-602; 069-614-933-063-039; 070-766-330-637-361; 071-096-667-564-23X; 071-242-952-806-704; 071-289-589-680-665; 071-400-089-018-491; 073-976-779-504-301; 075-869-949-597-475; 076-066-429-727-982; 077-219-459-120-576; 078-643-729-676-371; 081-200-948-841-870; 081-554-972-600-960; 083-431-802-681-908; 084-054-213-945-229; 084-933-203-004-469; 085-071-525-820-418; 085-814-373-949-830; 085-819-947-330-651; 086-489-976-456-04X; 086-778-509-846-306; 087-623-451-207-148; 090-354-304-762-622; 090-791-569-597-728; 091-176-530-870-506; 091-304-795-302-663; 091-447-044-003-038; 093-057-578-844-236; 093-843-281-390-438; 096-859-101-812-097; 097-018-840-296-292; 098-238-442-833-495; 099-574-432-366-407; 100-040-904-887-567; 100-094-576-812-673; 100-571-565-894-908; 100-757-594-939-146; 102-311-297-917-30X; 102-819-232-224-630; 103-129-201-670-337; 103-970-307-825-077; 106-999-506-881-248; 108-890-935-992-337; 109-422-399-668-929; 111-107-637-159-823; 113-305-062-375-022; 113-961-666-345-380; 114-713-320-798-212; 116-323-077-694-163; 118-083-769-951-389; 119-348-266-133-728; 122-487-805-045-777; 122-532-502-439-410; 127-694-339-064-359; 128-261-159-450-888; 142-431-565-357-044; 144-118-077-593-752; 146-323-454-314-794; 150-325-162-873-23X; 152-197-572-319-353; 159-194-110-004-649; 160-043-334-589-110; 160-309-085-366-551; 162-997-207-399-680; 164-471-831-808-317; 175-069-085-230-704; 181-150-342-777-512; 182-956-910-486-203,2

Graber; Ludmila Tsechansky; J. Khanukov; Y. Oka,"Sorption of the soil fumigant, 1,3-dichloropropene (DCP), on cornstraw biochar (fast pyrolysis at 500°C; specific surface area [SSA] of 3.0 m2 g−1) was strongly nonlinear and significantly greater on a soil–1% biochar mixture (26 Mg biochar ha−1) than on soil alone. This resulted in substantial reductions in DCP concentrations in the vapor phase. However, concentration of the fumigant in the aqueous phase of the soil, where it is active against soil nematodes, was also significantly reduced due to strong sorption to the biochar. In the studied system, adequate nematode control was achieved at 13 and 26 Mg biochar ha−1and DCP of 94 and 187 L ha−1, respectively, where the fumigant manufacturers suggested dose range of DCP is 84 to 514 L ha−1. Biochars produced at relatively high temperatures (>600°C) with a high SSA have been shown to absorb organic chemicals more strongly by one or more orders of magnitude than those, like the biochar used herein, produced at lower temperatures with a low SSA. Calculations show that adequate nematode control would not have been obtained had the biochar absorbed only five times more DCP per given solution concentration. Thus it is evident that while nematode control was adequate in the specific studied system, soil amendment with biochar could adversely impact pest control, depending on the sorption strength of the particular biochar. This issue should be considered when determining desirable biochar physical and chemical characteristics for use in agronomic systems.",75,4,1365,1373,"Environmental chemistry; Aqueous two-phase system; Specific surface area; Chemistry; 1,3-Dichloropropene; Amendment; Pyrolysis; Volatilisation; Biochar; Sorption",,,,Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Agriculture; Rural Development of Israel,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011SSASJ..75.1365G/abstract https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2136/sssaj2010.0435 https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/75/4/1365 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011SSASJ..75.1365G/abstract https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/300364,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2010.0435,,10.2136/sssaj2010.0435,2016542909,,0,000-108-564-650-258; 003-158-485-640-750; 003-273-955-910-65X; 005-269-482-866-425; 006-956-267-272-748; 010-170-335-431-14X; 010-938-192-820-185; 010-940-670-161-982; 012-124-981-808-322; 014-854-267-168-484; 017-033-285-847-983; 018-544-125-654-921; 019-517-123-990-940; 020-307-583-098-822; 022-445-339-768-677; 022-710-227-296-251; 022-811-822-344-046; 023-757-334-321-795; 027-717-039-104-367; 028-656-050-935-057; 032-248-777-496-085; 032-549-031-770-948; 037-301-046-232-838; 038-757-502-967-726; 047-540-196-347-068; 048-999-831-738-54X; 049-770-657-481-187; 057-562-865-464-30X; 061-155-827-911-312; 061-322-609-324-780; 061-728-097-587-658; 062-261-509-313-056; 062-710-603-262-639; 065-221-491-409-65X; 067-323-036-034-331; 069-079-910-778-320; 069-315-294-179-931; 070-189-818-769-90X; 071-480-400-593-951; 072-644-808-450-860; 072-930-271-984-64X; 076-248-350-391-889; 076-750-927-342-234; 080-209-223-726-853; 081-965-203-455-443; 086-718-493-763-148; 089-186-902-584-525; 091-582-965-498-495; 092-181-089-154-922; 093-947-845-856-421; 094-920-925-786-175; 095-942-339-311-867; 096-753-433-039-357; 097-736-854-061-108; 099-101-159-626-932; 102-114-420-279-911; 103-454-109-283-229; 108-848-538-643-708; 109-694-046-310-381; 111-107-637-159-823; 111-602-173-276-367; 111-825-483-964-278; 154-086-728-534-342; 160-019-098-024-918; 178-728-592-310-480; 188-575-507-931-425,65

Factorial randomized block design was used in this experiment and consisted of two factors. The first factor, biochar source, comprised four levels: B0: biochar without NPK, B1: rice straw biochar + NPK, B2: soybean straw biochar + NPK, and B3: wood biochar + NPK. The second factor, biochar enrichment, comprised four levels: D1: 0.5 tons ha -1 , D2: 2.5 tons ha -1 , D3: 5.0 tons ha -1 , and D4: 10 tons ha -1 . Each treatment was replicated three times, yielding 48 experiment units. The results showed that biochar enrichment with NPK affected the decomposition level. The percentage of increasing decomposition in enriched wood biochar (0.09%) was lower than rice (0.28%) and soybean (0.53%) straw biochar. An increase in NPK absorbance efficiency and soybean dry weight was evident in NPK-enriched biochar. The highest N absorbance efficiency occurred in wood biochar (21%), followed by soybean and rice straw biochar, respectively, while the highest P and K absorbances were found in rice straw biochar (35% and 26%, respectively), followed by wood and then soybean biochar.",17,1,35,41,Decomposition; Randomized block design; Dry weight; Ultisol; Chemistry; Straw; Rice straw; Biochar; Agronomy; Absorbance,,,,,https://jurnal.uns.ac.id/tanah/article/download/37608/27489 https://jurnal.uns.ac.id/tanah/article/view/37608,http://dx.doi.org/10.20961/stjssa.v17i1.37608,,10.20961/stjssa.v17i1.37608,3040428197,,0,015-170-264-115-036; 016-736-512-554-043; 029-612-295-284-493; 029-868-529-708-834; 030-534-360-426-297; 032-248-777-496-085; 057-745-940-430-655; 058-257-607-146-451; 064-070-266-691-159; 084-468-224-435-62X; 098-238-442-833-495; 113-153-896-641-913; 116-323-077-694-163; 125-523-300-302-285; 134-807-186-929-447; 157-296-470-031-653,4

In this study, we aimed to identify soil properties that determine the performance of biochar produced at high temperature (700 °C) on soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable base cation (Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+) content across a wide range of soil physicochemical properties. Ten distinct soils with varying physicochemical properties were incubated for 12 weeks with four rates of biochar application (0.5, 2, 4, and 8% w/w). Soil pH, CEC, and exchangeable base cations (Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+) were determined on the 7th and 84th day of incubation. Our results indicate that the highest biochar application rate (8%) was more effective at altering soil properties than lower biochar rates. Application of 8% biochar increased pH significantly in all incubated soils, with the increment ranging up to 1.17 pH unit. Biochar induced both an increment and a decline in soil CEC ranging up to 35.4 and 7.9%, respectively, at a biochar application rate of 8%. Similarly, biochar induced increments in exchangeable Ca2+ up to 38.6% and declines up to 11.4%, at an 8% biochar application rate. The increment in CEC and exchangeable Ca2+ content was found in soils with lower starting exchangeable Ca2+ contents than the biochar added, while decreases were observed in soils with higher exchangeable Ca2+ contents than the biochar. The original pH, CEC, exchangeable Ca2+, and texture of the soils represented the most crucial factors for determining the amount of change in soil pH, CEC, and exchangeable Ca2+ content. Our findings clearly demonstrate that application of a uniform biochar to a range of soils under equivalent environmental conditions induced two contradicting effects on soil properties including soil CEC and exchangeable Ca2+ content. Therefore, knowledge of both biochar and soil properties will substantially improve prediction of biochar application efficiency to improve soil properties. Among important soil properties, soil exchangeable Ca2+ content is the primary factor controlling the direction of biochar-induced change in soil CEC and exchangeable Ca2+ content. Generally, biochar can induce changes in soil pH, CEC, and exchangeable Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+ with the effectiveness and magnitude of change closely related to the soil’s original properties.",19,5,2405,2416,Environmental chemistry; Base (chemistry); Soil water; Chemistry; Cation-exchange capacity; Soil pH; Increased ph; Soil properties; Laboratory experiment; Biochar,,,,N?rodn?

Particle size and elemental analysis were used to characterize the biochar and CB. Cure characteristics, tensile, thermal, and morphological properties on the effect of biochar and CB as filler were studied. It was found that incorporating 10 phr of spent coffee biochar could improve the composites’ tensile properties and thermal performance compared to carbon black. However, the addition of biochar significantly affects the maximum torque compared to CB and delays the vulcanization time. SEM study shows that biochar has a strong effect on the morphology of composite films. The FTIR graph reveals no substantial difference between compounds with biochar and CB. According to the thermal calorimetric study, the thermal stability of ENR-Biochar is higher than that of ENR-CB. Additionally, these findings suggest that the utilization of spent coffee as a sustainable biochar could be further explored, but little has been done in epoxidized natural rubber (ENR).",13,16,2796,,Ultimate tensile strength; Environmentally friendly; Natural rubber; Materials science; Biocomposite; Chemical engineering; Carbon black; Vulcanization; Biochar; Thermal stability,biochar; carbon black; epoxidized natural rubber; spent coffee,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia (Research University Incentive (RUI) [Grant number 1001/PJJAUH/ 8011055].),https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8400960 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/13/16/2796/pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400960 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/13/16/2796/htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym13162796,34451334,10.3390/polym13162796,3193393270,PMC8400960,0,002-128-838-799-940; 002-229-148-396-709; 007-164-839-563-577; 007-707-375-163-505; 014-000-284-458-126; 020-844-760-840-260; 026-851-204-153-199; 031-147-543-119-704; 031-564-953-140-204; 034-769-550-393-811; 035-378-374-968-388; 040-000-168-026-708; 041-797-323-612-481; 044-438-700-398-877; 049-902-502-224-479; 053-797-846-130-946; 054-342-069-847-576; 066-296-520-893-19X; 067-729-188-411-706; 068-557-005-094-866; 080-942-498-451-408; 088-142-901-353-695; 096-396-518-401-447; 098-043-772-152-940; 121-226-123-816-448; 138-999-423-426-849; 152-094-354-435-231; 152-279-175-840-021; 153-708-237-035-319; 156-858-837-746-723; 168-892-508-131-52X; 170-192-742-282-259,0

Results and discussion Biochar applied in soil could increase the soil pH value, EC, ECEC, and SOC, and improve the soil physical and chemical properties to a certain extent. Biochar in soil could change the chemical form of Cd in soil, effectively passivate Cd in soil and reduce its bio-availability. Biochar could enhance the activities of catalase, urease, alkaline phosphatase and sucrase in soil to different degrees, and the four soil enzymes could be used as indicators of passivation effects of soil Cd by biochar. With biochar treatment, soil aggregates MWD and GMD increased to different degrees, so biochar could enhance soil stability. The biochar could decrease the content of Cd in different parts of wheat, the content of Cd in wheat grains had a highly significant positive correlation with the available content of Cd in soil, and highly significant or significant negative correlations with pH, SOC, EC, ECEC, and the activities of phosphatase, urease and sucrase in soil. Compared with ordinary biochar, the passivation effect of PEI-modified biochar on Cd was more significant.

G. Mitchell; Claudia Kammann,"Biochar may serve as a tool to sustainably mitigate climate change via carbon sequestration and by improving soil fertility. Biochar has shown to retain nitrate in its pores, which increases with an organic coating of the inner surfaces and residence time in soil (""aging""). Here we investigated the plant accessibility of the captured nitrate in field-aged biochar, as a pre-requisite for developing carbon-based N fertilization techniques with environmental benefits. Based on previous results, we hypothesized that part of the biochar-captured nitrate would remain unavailable for plants. A two-factorial greenhouse experiment was designed, where the N was applied either as Ca(NO3)2 or as N captured in field-aged biochar at five increasing N doses to quinoa and perennial ryegrass in pots. Interestingly, the biochar-captured N was as plant available as the mineral nitrate, except for the highest dosage. Refuting our hypothesis, no significant amounts of N were extractable at the end of the study from the biochar-soil mixtures with repeated-extraction protocols. Thus, N captured by biochar may improve the N use efficiency in agriculture. Further research should evaluate the role of biochar particle size, root morphology, mycorrhization, and soil moisture (variations) for nitrate retrieval from biochar particles by plants because the captured biochar N was less available in the field as under present controlled conditions.",10,1,13816,,Carbon sequestration; Perennial plant; Water content; Nitrate; Greenhouse; Soil fertility; Environmental science; Carbon; Biochar; Agronomy,,,,"Higher Education Commision, Pakistan; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70586-x.pdf https://ro.uow.edu.au/eispapers1/4327/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796884 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70586-x https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5356&context=eispapers1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70586-x,32796884,10.1038/s41598-020-70586-x,3049118180,PMC7427999,0,000-831-930-091-840; 001-507-320-015-949; 007-726-934-179-479; 009-165-006-816-493; 011-796-324-009-77X; 011-902-131-648-870; 013-116-208-415-528; 020-825-651-097-830; 022-254-546-121-962; 022-710-227-296-251; 024-387-946-516-957; 027-431-222-230-763; 028-450-893-192-497; 029-136-006-493-439; 029-580-624-703-780; 030-105-593-354-153; 031-136-551-203-689; 033-959-725-279-123; 035-387-018-589-482; 036-340-702-521-351; 038-575-306-394-388; 038-819-681-651-014; 043-670-455-261-921; 051-143-897-578-817; 052-595-984-911-749; 053-141-389-102-154; 054-879-041-435-270; 056-838-992-943-66X; 059-881-734-008-751; 060-785-251-667-475; 062-251-562-841-115; 063-783-470-941-251; 064-127-283-955-472; 065-283-892-265-013; 079-385-504-627-680; 083-191-308-637-493; 083-937-733-878-43X; 086-292-810-642-548; 087-416-813-441-985; 088-581-297-223-847; 090-254-585-430-158; 093-622-875-856-144; 101-002-266-754-979; 105-954-200-648-800; 114-566-767-601-247; 124-937-170-691-174; 137-516-571-419-493; 138-279-301-804-973; 149-996-811-965-735; 163-045-083-855-143; 184-261-773-220-661; 189-632-144-991-57X,13

Bamboo biochar can increase soil carbon content, improve soil fertility and restore the degraded soil. Previously we found that bamboo-biochar was effective to improve maize yield with an optimum dosage 10.52 t ha -1 biochar. Here, we examined the effectiveness of bamboo-biochar combined with compost and NPK fertilizer to improved soil quality and crop yield. In this experiment, we used a randomized block design (RBD) with two factors, three replications. The first factor was biochar dosage (four levels), namely without biochar,  biochar dosage 5.26 t ha -1 , biochar dosage 10.52 t ha -1 , biochar dosage 15.78 t ha -1 . The second factor is the type of fertilizer with four types, namely: without fertilizer, compost, NPK, and compost+NPK. The results showed that biochar dosage 10.52 t ha -1 combined with compost+NPK could increase P and K availability, increase total soil microbes, and improved soil quality to be very good with soil quality rating value 18. The biochar dosage 10.52 t ha -1 combined with compost+NPK gave the dry weight seed-corn highest of 12.84 tons per hectare that increased 38.61% when compared with without biochar and with compost+NPK. The highest yield 12.84 tons of the dry weight of seed-corn per hectare provides the highest effectiveness-agronomic value 119.69% and feasibility of corn crop farming in drylands value 1.27.",8,5,2241,2248,Crop yield; Randomized block design; Soil quality; Fertilizer; Compost; Mathematics; Soil fertility; Soil carbon; Biochar; Agronomy,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.18517/ijaseit.8.5.2179 http://dx.doi.org/10.18517/ijaseit.8.5.2179 http://ijaseit.insightsociety.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9&Itemid=1&article_id=2179 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/296922152.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.18517/ijaseit.8.5.2179,,10.18517/ijaseit.8.5.2179,2899272889,,0,007-874-227-040-990; 008-927-827-512-667; 012-190-732-799-598; 017-716-449-910-25X; 022-445-339-768-677; 024-346-381-590-007; 027-474-711-827-405; 028-656-050-935-057; 036-579-514-261-26X; 039-775-040-456-520; 046-020-256-904-183; 055-050-502-702-231; 089-911-460-251-561; 095-745-482-920-080; 106-693-719-816-704; 174-685-171-957-400; 192-096-254-707-746,7

This work investigated the effects of water washing, oxidation, and coexistence of aluminum (Al) on cadmium (Cd) adsorption by biochars and oxidized biochars. The Cd adsorption and the competitive adsorption of Cd and Al to rice straw-derived biochars, before and after oxidation by HNO3/H2SO4, were investigated. Meanwhile, the structural characteristics and surface charges of primary and oxidized biochars, with and without Cd loading, were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and zeta potential. The adsorption of Cd onto fresh biochars was dominated by surface complexation of oxygen-containing functional groups via esterification reactions, which was regulated by solution pH. Oxidization (aging) introduced carboxylic functional groups to biochar surfaces, which served as additional binding sites for Cd. The Cd binding to biochars was significantly affected by the coexistence of Al via acidification and competition for adsorption sites. The biochars exhibited high sorption capacities of Cd in soil, but soil acidification led to a counteractive of biochar’s liming effect and a reduction of Cd-binding sites; thus, the long-term effect of biochar for heavy metal immobilization should be paid more attention in acidic soil.",15,5,1130,1138,Environmental chemistry; Adsorption; Inorganic chemistry; Soil acidification; Chemistry; Soil pH; Surface charge; Metal; Cadmium; Biochar; Sorption,,,,,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.springer-e8d938ff-ce60-3288-8ce0-dad474c68f5b https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11368-015-1073-y https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-015-1073-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-015-1073-y,,10.1007/s11368-015-1073-y,2084717026,,0,000-904-984-287-341; 001-247-292-389-370; 002-478-251-608-893; 004-748-318-690-722; 007-110-670-751-658; 007-414-469-434-872; 008-068-320-957-947; 012-078-978-268-279; 013-455-492-256-11X; 016-164-478-595-085; 017-407-551-791-323; 021-374-592-487-244; 021-695-256-954-736; 021-705-104-175-086; 022-082-203-634-207; 022-334-846-527-323; 022-710-227-296-251; 023-341-514-331-465; 025-306-354-387-310; 028-767-583-508-367; 030-382-287-804-107; 031-136-255-381-114; 031-860-069-629-961; 036-803-033-808-328; 039-324-778-204-060; 039-867-547-589-742; 047-865-062-084-376; 049-683-389-741-206; 054-736-477-884-650; 056-861-562-617-472; 057-562-865-464-30X; 064-017-998-040-631; 065-891-275-256-831; 065-914-148-852-074; 066-394-152-634-475; 066-688-856-005-195; 070-485-874-036-520; 073-700-555-438-168; 075-965-974-624-48X; 091-372-258-817-148; 093-947-845-856-421; 094-759-287-369-861; 104-538-078-664-137; 104-809-609-597-503; 104-977-942-794-677; 105-660-792-197-076; 108-370-910-592-389; 108-606-741-312-523; 114-541-024-137-411; 118-730-360-794-507; 122-299-578-345-260; 125-425-346-797-173; 128-987-516-708-342; 163-693-684-972-092,66

Grain yield, plant biomass, P accumulation, leaf net photosynthetic rate (Pn), chlorophyll index (Chl), nitrogen balance index (NBI), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), and sucrose synthase (SS) activities, soluble sugar, sucrose and starch contents, and leaf area duration (LAD) were measured. Biochar had positive effects on Pn, Chl, NBI, SPS, and SS activities, and leaf soluble sugar, sucrose, and starch contents of both genotypes, these effects increased with biochar application rate. L13 benefited more efficiently from biochar than T3 did, as the grain yield of L13 significantly increased by 31.0 and 51.0%, at 5 and 10% biochar, respectively, while that of T3 increased by 40.4 at 10% biochar application rate, as compared with controls. The combined application of biochar and fertilizer boosted the positive effects described, but no difference was found for grain yield in L13 among biochar application rates, while grain yield of T3 continually increased with biochar rate, among which, 1% biochar combined with 150 kg ha−1 fertilizer resulted in T3 yield increment of more than 23%, compared with the application of 150 kg ha−1 fertilizer alone. Altogether, our results indicated that the application of biochar enhanced carbon assimilation in soybean, resulting in increased biomass accumulation and yield. Differences in genotypic responses to biochar highlight the need to consider specific cultivars and biochar rate, when evaluating the potential responses of crops to biochar.",18,10,2242,2254,Horticulture; Photosynthesis; Chemistry; Sucrose synthase; Sugar; Sucrose-phosphate synthase; Fertilizer; Phosphorus; Biochar; Nitrogen balance,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311919625633 https://www.chinaagrisci.com/Jwk_zgnykxen/CN/abstract/abstract22471.shtml https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2095311919625633 https://doaj.org/article/763ea5f95de04bf2b0cc4c3032b572ee,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s2095-3119(19)62563-3,,10.1016/s2095-3119(19)62563-3,2979338279,,0,000-611-479-251-859; 000-705-944-825-940; 001-226-114-892-560; 001-409-626-478-576; 002-873-475-102-613; 003-942-726-047-325; 011-864-502-462-553; 012-822-241-724-105; 013-099-934-761-175; 015-693-191-968-97X; 016-400-903-838-327; 033-829-663-086-442; 036-419-058-463-913; 039-775-040-456-520; 044-018-344-490-050; 044-767-339-153-357; 048-890-034-119-974; 049-623-955-447-745; 051-617-388-667-637; 061-046-681-496-618; 065-281-086-727-480; 067-230-367-959-408; 067-238-196-041-737; 070-514-989-335-256; 072-489-241-063-730; 074-545-154-933-861; 079-762-564-920-732; 081-174-550-423-12X; 081-634-902-855-853; 084-724-376-137-170; 085-560-907-942-995; 087-085-325-032-951; 088-505-587-907-61X; 088-793-868-206-034; 093-789-937-374-779; 094-933-657-705-561; 096-788-152-235-79X; 102-819-232-224-630; 103-273-773-136-750; 105-644-444-715-017; 106-797-268-116-835; 109-176-351-206-409; 109-422-399-668-929; 110-379-437-278-257; 110-549-994-599-749; 116-352-649-264-162; 122-177-512-802-62X; 144-708-120-401-366; 146-278-584-253-408; 148-730-341-510-597; 150-781-961-661-822; 161-642-402-566-30X; 188-575-507-931-425,18

In this paper, starting with the measurement of biochar's electrical properties under different pyrolysis atmospheres and temperatures, the changes in the zeta potential of biochar and the consequent effects on cadmium immobilization in soil are studied. The results show that the zeta potential of biochar from the pyrolysis of high temperature (800 °C) is higher than that of biochar at low temperatures, so its electronegativity is weaker than that of biochar at low temperatures, but the protective effect on wheat is stronger than that of biochar obtained at low temperatures. The zeta potential of biochar obtained under a CO2 atmosphere was higher than that of biochar prepared under a N2 atmosphere, so its protective effect on wheat was stronger than that of biochar under N2. The reason is that biochar particles with a high zeta potential and weak electronegativity have higher cohesion and are better at in situ passivation of Cd in soils. Namely, biochar obtained at high pyrolysis temperatures (800 °C) and prepared under a CO2 atmosphere has better effect on Cd immobilization.",26,19,19738,19748,Environmental chemistry; Soil water; Electronegativity; Chemistry; Heavy metals; Passivation; Pyrolysis; Cadmium; Biochar; Zeta potential,Biochar; Colloidal cohesion; Electronegativity; Heavy metal Cd; Zeta potential,Cadmium/analysis; Charcoal/chemistry; Farms; Hot Temperature; Pyrolysis; Soil/chemistry; Soil Pollutants/analysis; Surface Properties,Soil; Soil Pollutants; biochar; Cadmium; Charcoal,"National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0800702, 2018YFD0800703); National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.41571283)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31090000/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090000 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-019-05298-5 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6481779,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05298-5,31090000,10.1007/s11356-019-05298-5,2946171422,,0,001-694-086-192-862; 002-753-753-176-799; 003-908-636-825-622; 004-050-487-597-460; 007-907-739-609-43X; 008-250-395-410-680; 010-059-082-582-63X; 010-629-137-799-716; 011-151-498-558-148; 012-499-820-114-38X; 013-515-286-113-072; 013-987-096-981-667; 016-164-478-595-085; 018-732-147-416-092; 019-484-475-910-31X; 021-138-402-889-994; 021-705-104-175-086; 021-754-863-383-231; 021-950-935-264-900; 023-719-986-160-563; 029-823-503-779-520; 032-653-668-609-051; 034-588-855-658-419; 034-989-130-435-75X; 036-623-188-983-448; 040-241-006-582-397; 040-936-314-978-466; 048-648-054-998-413; 048-698-224-702-853; 049-221-929-556-428; 050-214-144-260-117; 050-227-152-486-338; 051-914-439-085-954; 052-650-222-565-420; 055-398-669-011-341; 056-600-297-840-095; 057-625-221-733-215; 059-681-407-612-410; 062-442-705-239-60X; 062-627-382-878-167; 063-988-851-384-806; 065-717-958-498-991; 066-255-012-744-285; 068-944-393-652-849; 070-368-120-143-44X; 074-774-417-853-273; 075-193-577-479-55X; 076-003-890-481-089; 081-269-168-322-362; 082-404-571-442-036; 096-941-725-873-448; 102-208-731-795-54X; 103-966-540-016-856; 104-809-609-597-503; 119-909-564-212-712; 127-715-486-287-456; 145-128-340-424-266; 159-319-530-823-428,16

Ippolito; J. L. Ullman; Kamran Ansari; Liqiang Cui; Altaf Ali Siyal,"Irrigation water quality plays a vital role in sustaining crop productivity and feeding a growing world population. In many countries, continued agricultural water reuse can lead to greater water-soluble salt concentrations, and in particular Na; finding means by which irrigation water Na, and thus sodium adsorption ratios (SAR), can be reduced would reduce the rate at which soil sodification occurs. Four biochars, containing a variety of organic functional groups and electrochemistries, were examined for their potential to sorb and remove Na from simulated irrigation water, and subsequently reduce water SAR. Two batch experiments examined the role that wheat straw biochar, lodgepole pine biochar, Kentucky bluegrass biochar, and hemp biochar played in terms of sorbing sodium over time or application rate. Of the four biochars examined, hemp biochar had the lowest oxidation–reduction potential (ORP; ~ 0–100 mV), sorbed the greatest Na amount (up to 923 mg kg−1), and released Ca and Mg (up to 115 and 63 mg kg−1, respectively) into solution, all of which led to a significant reduction in water SAR (from 8.8 to 7.3; 17% decrease). Sodium sorption onto hemp biochar better fit a Langmuir versus a Freundlich isotherm, yet followed a pseudo-second-order model better than a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The data suggest that Na ions formed a monolayer on the hemp biochar surface, influenced by associations with π electrons, but given time the Na ions may diffuse into biochar pores or more slowly interact with biochar-borne π electrons. Hemp biochar shows promise in reducing the SAR of Na-impacted waters. Future investigations should focus on additional laboratory, greenhouse, and field trials with hemp biochar and other biochars designed to have similar or superior properties for sorbing excess irrigation water Na and improving crop growth.",3,1,77,87,Environmental chemistry; Freundlich equation; Langmuir; Adsorption; Chemistry; Sodium adsorption ratio; Straw; Sodium; Biochar; Sorption,,,,United States Agency for International Development,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42773-020-00073-z.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42773-020-00073-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42773-020-00073-z,,10.1007/s42773-020-00073-z,3098645573,,0,002-320-768-472-175; 003-434-980-796-646; 003-942-726-047-325; 005-200-889-236-761; 008-795-580-345-008; 011-473-495-135-969; 012-078-978-268-279; 014-205-849-175-318; 014-430-398-699-34X; 024-946-716-836-005; 026-459-668-136-913; 029-823-503-779-520; 030-338-971-314-309; 032-036-186-522-726; 037-646-685-606-342; 038-621-430-973-816; 042-130-039-354-703; 044-565-223-280-64X; 048-084-081-953-607; 049-225-452-457-972; 049-925-326-111-61X; 052-695-862-360-342; 056-190-238-127-194; 060-809-073-172-093; 066-688-856-005-195; 069-411-267-012-01X; 070-356-122-550-673; 071-150-398-970-567; 071-571-681-707-460; 076-511-418-358-475; 085-927-029-349-861; 088-587-088-685-719; 092-372-340-918-85X; 096-529-702-517-008; 114-448-703-850-108; 116-668-583-301-24X; 139-835-964-451-102; 141-243-023-063-848; 147-469-892-140-972; 147-775-220-772-622,5

Yet, the impacts of biochar and mixtures with compound effective microorganisms (CEM) on alfalfa growth and soil quality in coastal wetlands are poorly understood. A greenhouse experiment was set to systematically reveal the impacts of biochar and biochar combined with CEM on alfalfa growth traits, nutrient uptake, biomass, soil quality, and enzyme activities. Eight treatments were included: (1) control (CK−CEM), (2) 10-g/kg biochar (B<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>−CEM); (3) 20-g/kg biochar (B<jats:sub>20</jats:sub>−CEM); (4) 30-g/kg biochar (B<jats:sub>30</jats:sub>−CEM), (5) CEM without biochar (CK + CEM); (6) 10-g/kg biochar with CEM (B<jats:sub>10</jats:sub> + CEM), (7) 20-g/kg biochar with CEM (B<jats:sub>20</jats:sub> + CEM), (8) 30-g/kg biochar with CEM (B<jats:sub>30</jats:sub> + CEM). The utilization of biochar promoted seed germination, height, and tissue nutrient contents of alfalfa, and the combined biochar with CEM showed greater effects. Alfalfa biomass showed the maximum value in the B<jats:sub>20</jats:sub> + CEM treatment, and the biomass of root, shoot, leaf in the B<jats:sub>20</jats:sub> + CEM treatment increased by 200, 117.3, 144.6%, respectively, relative to the CK−CEM treatment. Alfalfa yield in the CK + CEM, B<jats:sub>10</jats:sub> + CEM, B<jats:sub>20</jats:sub> + CEM, B<jats:sub>30</jats:sub> + CEM treatments was 71.91, 84.11, 138.5, and 120.5% higher than those in the CK−CEM treatment. The use of biochar and CEM decreased soil salinity and elevated soil nutrient content effectively. Biochar elevated soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup>, and enzymatic activities, and the positive impacts of biochar combined with CEM were additive. The combined addition of 20-g/kg biochar with CEM showed the pronounced improvement effects on improving soil fertility and nutrient availability as well as soil enzyme activities. Path analysis indicated that the application of biochar mixture with CEM promoted alfalfa biomass by regulating plant nutrient uptake, soil quality (soil nitrogen, SOC, MBC, NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup>), and soil enzymatic activities (sucrase, urease, and alkaline phosphatases). Thus, incorporation of suitable biochar and CEM can serve as an effective measure to promote alfalfa productivity and restore coastal wetlands soils.</jats:p>",9,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.798520,,10.3389/fevo.2021.798520,,,0,002-368-697-121-847; 005-800-287-261-088; 006-654-427-477-483; 007-541-372-936-050; 012-353-094-021-610; 013-669-917-287-848; 013-798-820-477-195; 016-165-652-777-955; 016-833-475-258-492; 022-104-504-693-918; 022-619-823-710-490; 022-858-967-816-866; 027-158-566-481-748; 028-559-249-001-484; 033-356-968-158-809; 033-575-702-013-91X; 033-896-842-875-287; 036-579-514-261-26X; 040-197-102-403-779; 042-449-335-642-51X; 042-483-115-741-398; 042-987-500-793-556; 043-129-237-121-175; 044-545-335-061-814; 046-910-288-014-286; 048-622-415-185-739; 048-862-364-198-056; 054-722-689-424-907; 055-992-099-924-481; 058-138-978-748-337; 058-595-899-587-962; 058-684-192-549-414; 061-337-431-399-313; 064-853-335-566-046; 065-281-086-727-480; 065-980-597-756-550; 074-045-309-139-056; 080-936-282-444-689; 083-616-316-390-639; 089-955-150-993-660; 093-947-845-856-421; 096-325-953-844-455; 098-552-040-015-09X; 102-230-524-973-690; 103-470-191-545-16X; 105-582-151-332-812; 106-334-222-687-623; 108-144-112-335-016; 119-289-005-223-509; 122-877-018-188-836; 125-766-922-988-230; 127-543-641-632-240; 129-650-658-357-376; 131-401-756-863-517; 158-395-006-016-695; 166-521-546-451-297; 173-764-034-825-881,0

Alghamdi; Bandar H. Aljohani; Anwar A. Aly,"In this study, waste olive leaves and branches were pyrolyzed to produced biochar, and their impacts on physical and chemical properties of a sandy soil were evaluated. Pyrolytic temperatures of 300 °C, 400 °C, and 500 °C were used for biochar production. After evaluating the physio-chemical properties, the produced biochars were added to the top 10 cm layer of the soil at rates of 0%, 1%, 3%, and 5% in a column experiment at 25 °C. Biochar was mixed with a sandy soil into the top 10 cm of the columns. For all treatments, cumulative evaporation was reduced; however, treatments with 5% biochar prepared at the highest temperatures showed the highest impact. The available water contents were increased by 153.33% and 151.11% when olive branch-derived biochar and olive leaves-derived biochars produced at 500 °C were applied at 5% rate, respectively. No impact of available water was observed for 1% biochar contribution. Biochar application decreased both cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate. Biochar pyrolyzed at 500 °C most intensely improved hydro-physical properties of a sandy soil. However, its application as a soil supplement in arid environments should be adopted with constraints due to its high pH (9.69 and 9.29 for biochar pyrolyzed at the highest temperatures) and salinity (up to electrical conductivity = 5.07 dS m−1). However, the salinity of biochar prepared from olive branches (5%, pyrolyzed at 500 °C) was low (0.79 dS m−1); therefore, it can be used safely as a supplement in saline and acidic soils, but with restriction in alkaline soils.",13,10,5493,,Environmental chemistry; Salinity; Alkali soil; Infiltration (HVAC); Soil conditioner; Chemistry; Soil pH; Pyrolysis; Biochar; Evaporation,,,,"Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/10/5493/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/10/5493 https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v13y2021i10p5493-d554484.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13105493,,10.3390/su13105493,3160958291,,0,003-838-855-400-543; 004-758-306-376-671; 009-801-931-535-028; 017-267-256-160-914; 022-445-339-768-677; 028-572-685-549-493; 028-603-561-741-239; 028-644-527-904-496; 034-658-955-805-173; 035-430-716-649-789; 036-434-097-873-099; 037-889-549-819-884; 039-651-625-088-263; 043-184-750-793-177; 043-513-409-072-936; 044-778-703-327-987; 052-464-159-097-521; 052-555-380-587-152; 059-003-128-993-115; 059-333-276-485-464; 061-503-935-105-21X; 062-261-509-313-056; 074-820-124-008-636; 075-733-353-931-820; 086-977-278-596-54X; 100-442-956-486-732; 100-571-565-894-908; 104-513-340-688-839; 104-993-235-027-460; 105-224-864-824-876; 107-539-466-591-914; 112-460-582-219-414; 113-566-710-670-552; 113-653-670-832-566; 114-351-981-672-486; 128-824-583-478-261; 131-732-006-495-977; 150-815-518-250-79X,1

The results showed that morphology structure, specific surface area, pore size distribution, and element contents of the biochars were superior to the biochars prepared under traditional inert atmosphere (N2) and the same four pyrolysis temperatures. In comparison with the rice straw, pore structure of biochars was mainly mesoporous and more developed, average pore size decreased, and BET-specific surface area increased with the increase of temperature from 300 to 800 °C. Biochars distributed abundant mesopores and macropores under 400 and 600 °C; the maximum macropores of the biochar were shaped under 600 °C. Concentration of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) increased significantly with increasing temperature, while that of nitrogen (N) first increased and then decreased and reached a maximum at 400 °C.

Biochar, produced by pyrolysis of biomass, may help attain these goals. The desire to advance understanding of the environmental and agronomic implication of biochar utilization led to the organization of the 2010 ASA-CSSA-SSSA Environmental Quality Division session entitled Biochar Effects on the Environment and Agricultural Productivity (Long Beach, CA; Oct. 31-Nov. 3). Twenty-five presentations from this session, and sessions at the 2010 U.S. Biochar Initiative Conference (Ames, IA; June 27-30) and Biochar Symposium 2010 (organized by Dr. Bruno Glaser; University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany, July 8-9), make up a special collection of review and technical research papers focused on biochar creation and utilization.

Al-Wabel; Hamna Saleem,"Biochar, due to its heterogeneity, may not be equally effective for cationic and anionic metals/metalloid immobilization in soil. Biochar modification could facilitate the immobilization of specific metals/metalloids in soil. This study explored the potential of unmodified and modified (with KMnO4) biochars derived from sawdust and rice husk at two different temperatures (300 and 700 °C) on the mobility of arsenic (As) in contaminated soil. Soil column leaching experiments were performed with two application rates (2% and 5%; w/w) of different biochars, and the pore waters at different time intervals were analyzed for As and other cations and anion concentrations. In general, all the biochars increased As mobility in soil. The biochars produced at 300 °C significantly and highly increased As concentrations (up to 341%) in pore waters, as compared with the unamended soil. However, the modified biochars showed As immobilization in soil as compared with their unmodified counterparts. The mechanisms of biochar interaction with As in soil were investigated by developing correlations of As with various chemical constituents. It was inferred that As mobilization was increased due to competition between As and PO43−. Contrarily, immobilization of As in soil by modified biochars was related to sorption onto Fe- and Mn-oxides. Pristine biochar may not be an efficient remediation measure for As-contaminated soil. There could be a risk of As leaching into groundwater from soils amended with biochar. However, it is recommended that modification of biochar may assist the immobilization of As in soil.",20,9,3358,3367,Environmental chemistry; Soil water; Chemistry; Sawdust; Environmental remediation; Biochar; Sorption; Soil contamination; Husk; Leaching (metallurgy),,,,,https://www.scilit.net/article/d85948dd3d5f640dc7bdd680578aad14 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-020-02661-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02661-9,,10.1007/s11368-020-02661-9,3025543909,,0,002-787-499-958-255; 005-167-685-607-442; 008-068-320-957-947; 011-092-971-210-685; 011-604-057-752-34X; 012-440-694-367-426; 012-705-850-379-981; 012-877-657-125-622; 013-800-716-011-758; 016-164-478-595-085; 028-129-125-110-662; 031-385-361-272-47X; 034-289-540-454-032; 039-659-797-052-36X; 042-783-652-101-817; 044-701-680-946-084; 049-551-430-144-24X; 058-515-088-306-562; 058-736-751-245-268; 059-143-114-968-060; 063-946-861-544-185; 068-912-183-787-909; 070-863-893-011-738; 077-129-148-016-65X; 087-298-296-671-947; 087-578-243-817-152; 098-961-700-853-10X; 107-138-932-674-93X; 107-434-362-854-328; 113-385-810-039-415; 118-584-828-722-064; 125-869-468-392-729; 134-349-238-155-848; 146-831-366-989-856; 156-364-173-816-636; 159-655-388-811-815; 164-133-063-326-347; 191-595-252-652-323,2

To enhance scalability, biochar incorporation needs to be integrated into conventional mechanised tillage systems. This study aimed at assessing the effects of incorporating biochar by power tiller and ox-plough on soil water retention, maize growth and yield. A 2 x 3 factorial experiment was conducted in a split-plot design with biochar incorporating method as a main plot factor and biochar level as subplot factor, on ferralsols of central Uganda. Incorporation methods were by power tiller and ox-plough with hand mixing in planting basins as a control, while levels of biochar were 0 and 10 t ha-1 application rates. Data was analysed using two-way ANOVAs in Minitab for significant differences among incorporation methods. Results showed that incorporating biochar by power tiller significantly increased water retention effect of biochar by 27.5% (p < 0.05), while no significant effect was observed (p ≥ 0.05) when incorporated by ox-plough, compared to hand mixing. No significant difference on growth and yield was observed (p ≥ 0.05) as a result of incorporating biochar by power tiller and ox-plough instead of hands in planting basins. These findings suggest that biochar incorporation can be scaled-up, to commercial levels, through the use of power tiller and ox-plough, without negative effects on biochar performance. It is recommended that promotion of biochar technology encompasses the use of power tillers and ox-ploughs to enhance scalability.",6,4,93,,Soil water; Tillage; Sowing; Factorial experiment; Plough; Tiller; Water retention; Mathematics; Biochar; Agronomy,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ags/ccsesa/265171.html https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/265171 http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/sar/article/download/69447/38486 https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/sar/article/download/69447/38486,http://dx.doi.org/10.5539/sar.v6n4p93,,10.5539/sar.v6n4p93,2755489220,,0,038-072-617-079-567; 044-307-106-632-560; 045-604-366-041-916; 049-098-921-731-454; 049-433-412-200-861; 108-090-378-550-839; 129-807-748-443-22X; 194-759-577-595-598,2

Buchkina; Eugene Balashov,"Since biochar is considered to be a significant source of carbon, in this work we have evaluated the changes in soil organic matter (SOM) and soil structure due to application of biochar and biochar with N fertilization, and have considered the interrelationships between the SOM parameters and the soil structure. The soil samples were collected from Haplic Luvisol at the locality of Dolná Malanta (Slovakia) during 2017. The field experiment included three rates of biochar application (B0 - no biochar, B10 - biochar at the rate of 10 t ha-1, B20 - biochar at the rate of 20 t ha-1) and three levels of N fertilization (N0 - no nitrogen, N160 - nitrogen at the rate of 160 kg ha-1, N240 - nitrogen at the rate of 240 kg ha-1). The rate of biochar at 20 t ha-1 caused an increase in the organic carbon (Corg) content. The combination of both rates of biochar with 160 and 240 kg N ha-1 also caused an increase in Corg. In the case of B20 the extractability of humic substances carbon (CHS) was 17.79% lower than at B0. A significant drop was also observed in the values of the extraction of humic acids carbon (CHA) and fulvic acids carbon (CFA) after the addition of biochar at a dose of 20 t ha-1 with 160 kg N ha-1. However, both rates of biochar had a significant effect at 240 kg N ha-1. After application of 20 t ha-1 of biochar the content of water-stable macro-aggregates (WSAma) significantly increased compared to control. This rate of biochar also increased the mean weight diameter (MWDW) and the index of water-stable aggregates (Sw) and decreased the coefficient of vulnerability (Kv). The biochar at a rate of 20 t ha-1 with 240 kg N ha-1 the value of MWDW increased and value of Kv decreased significantly. The contents of Corg and CL correlated positively with WSAma, MWDW and Sw and negatively with WSAmi and Kv. The extraction of CHA and CFA was in negative relationship with MWDW.

Biochars were produced at three carbonization temperatures of 500, 700 and 900 °C. pH values of the biochars increased from slightly alkaline to highly alkaline as carbonization temperature increased. Electrical conductivities of the biochars were between 1.21 and 4.07 mS/cm. The specific surface areas of the Kanlow Switchgrass derived biochars increased from 0.91 to 519.49 m2/g and 0.25 to 783.74 m2/g for Public Miscanthus derived biochars as carbonization temperature increased. Surface topographies of the biochars showed that all the biochars had visible pores of varying sizes and shapes. Raman spectra for all the biochars showed overlapping D and G bands. XPS analysis showed a reduction in the atomic percentage of oxygen functional groups as carbonization temperature increased. The improvement in the characteristics of the biochars showed that high carbonization temperatures can significantly enhance the satisfactory performance of herbaceous biomass-derived biochar as a solid fuel, adsorbent, and soil amendment.",8,5,104169,,Adsorption; Carbonization; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Chemistry; Miscanthus; Amendment; Herbaceous biomass; Chemical engineering; Oxygen; Biochar,,,,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343720305170,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2020.104169,,10.1016/j.jece.2020.104169,3034393719,,0,001-472-889-910-772; 003-825-243-170-06X; 004-758-306-376-671; 005-499-322-267-507; 007-020-043-043-40X; 008-068-320-957-947; 008-201-612-171-006; 009-544-945-854-076; 013-063-982-279-899; 013-376-401-726-45X; 013-550-648-417-393; 017-651-802-266-174; 023-248-717-925-574; 023-306-869-494-753; 024-976-715-743-12X; 026-133-648-801-808; 026-594-335-831-40X; 030-053-860-969-610; 030-448-473-703-835; 030-860-838-294-080; 033-829-663-086-442; 034-188-507-197-086; 037-293-854-097-50X; 043-142-105-983-503; 044-565-223-280-64X; 046-432-884-164-420; 048-448-805-243-075; 049-551-430-144-24X; 051-735-902-040-333; 053-795-767-326-028; 055-653-289-115-62X; 056-087-522-978-353; 060-457-082-527-961; 068-731-920-777-880; 068-944-393-652-849; 070-738-843-088-961; 076-942-262-601-735; 077-017-855-472-711; 080-318-966-071-07X; 083-005-660-513-893; 083-147-886-557-198; 086-585-071-406-814; 087-511-814-264-111; 088-318-606-762-978; 097-476-047-949-911; 101-571-880-727-612; 108-051-634-609-018; 111-138-778-226-155; 121-558-722-982-481; 127-683-983-261-544; 129-765-627-725-367; 132-991-442-485-292; 149-239-581-793-449; 174-685-171-957-400,12

When the addition amount of the biochars was 0.5%, the maximum adsorption amount of As (V) was decreased in the order of dairy manure biochar > pine needle biochar > corn straw biochar, which was related to the basic characteristics of the biochars. The adsorption isotherm of As (V) could be well fitted by Langmuir model (R2 = 0.997). In comparing with CK, both the adsorption capacity (lgKf = 1.99-2.10) and the adsorption intensity (1/N = 0.413-0.449) of As (V) were low, and the main adsorption mechanism was physical adsorption. The desorption rate of As (V) (14.5%-18.7%) was decreased in the order of dairy manure biochar > pine needle biochar > corn straw biochar. The addition of the biochars decreased the adsorption of As (V) by brown soil, which could induce the increase of the bioavailability of As, and strengthen the toxicity of As in soil.",24,10,2941,2946,Environmental chemistry; Langmuir adsorption model; Adsorption; Desorption; Bioavailability; Chemistry; Straw; Manure; Arsenic; Biochar; Agronomy,,"Adsorption; Animals; Arsenic/chemistry; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cattle; Charcoal/chemistry; China; Manure; Soil Pollutants/chemistry",Manure; Soil Pollutants; biochar; Charcoal; Arsenic,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483091 https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-YYSB201310032.htm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483091,24483091,,2359487158,,0,,0

The property of biochar produced is much dependent upon the composition and type of biomass and the conditions at which biomass is carbonized. The physical and chemical characterizations are necessary to identify the basic structure and property of biochar and to predict its potential in various environmental application. Biochar is a promising alternative to remedy the soils contaminated with heavy metals and organic compounds through adsorption and immobilization due to its large surface area, charged surface, and functional groups. Overall, the bioavailability of heavy metals and organic compounds decreases when biochar is amended into soils.",2014,,1,12,Environmental chemistry; Contamination; Adsorption; Carbonization; Soil water; Bioavailability; Materials science; Heavy metals; Biomass; Biochar; Agronomy,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2014/715398.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/89256293 http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2014/715398.pdf https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2014/715398/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/715398,,10.1155/2014/715398,2081878630,,0,000-589-838-797-960; 002-530-453-439-480; 002-568-181-459-771; 003-158-485-640-750; 003-417-911-283-615; 004-002-075-995-634; 005-519-979-387-322; 006-834-572-275-915; 007-115-170-911-072; 008-068-320-957-947; 008-166-019-146-829; 008-192-841-912-195; 008-314-384-655-260; 008-653-919-313-459; 009-544-945-854-076; 010-938-192-820-185; 011-298-420-957-938; 011-967-044-441-06X; 012-090-656-890-702; 012-190-732-799-598; 013-310-761-360-613; 013-882-424-881-286; 015-818-626-255-909; 016-329-925-445-39X; 019-017-717-744-500; 019-064-680-775-70X; 019-571-953-248-611; 019-870-454-207-153; 020-312-209-688-255; 020-573-657-346-30X; 020-834-719-642-01X; 021-705-104-175-086; 021-950-935-264-900; 023-248-717-925-574; 023-761-888-465-83X; 024-282-338-548-292; 024-362-112-781-665; 024-387-946-516-957; 025-306-354-387-310; 025-507-805-504-565; 025-525-094-831-541; 026-023-430-233-02X; 026-605-507-516-950; 027-375-944-303-502; 027-525-920-528-02X; 027-560-157-186-081; 027-717-039-104-367; 028-803-267-849-050; 028-829-712-355-776; 029-680-308-724-879; 030-011-026-908-677; 030-074-972-052-834; 030-403-543-432-948; 033-041-273-575-378; 033-861-095-242-928; 034-011-167-528-438; 034-588-855-658-419; 036-136-458-834-728; 036-363-058-587-078; 038-339-141-297-816; 038-757-502-967-726; 038-922-685-419-306; 041-849-850-866-581; 043-154-544-531-638; 047-322-274-693-519; 049-225-452-457-972; 049-683-389-741-206; 050-158-376-416-180; 052-100-987-605-969; 054-851-415-877-934; 056-402-509-152-562; 059-879-580-128-570; 061-017-240-161-457; 062-580-391-841-539; 063-062-572-035-284; 066-168-522-917-072; 066-688-856-005-195; 072-244-543-247-089; 074-481-396-689-304; 075-793-458-190-47X; 077-161-119-947-973; 077-279-632-991-098; 077-930-823-429-268; 078-403-412-749-795; 079-687-121-234-525; 086-419-129-321-263; 087-298-738-675-452; 091-438-961-751-848; 093-057-578-844-236; 093-157-100-268-83X; 093-947-845-856-421; 095-882-703-921-601; 101-588-398-633-758; 101-649-118-457-718; 102-057-943-251-792; 103-410-153-297-594; 106-797-268-116-835; 106-890-058-775-687; 107-539-466-591-914; 109-694-046-310-381; 110-799-760-950-868; 111-107-637-159-823; 111-654-197-571-576; 114-838-421-876-557; 115-422-293-140-605; 116-323-077-694-163; 118-151-336-703-410; 118-597-616-788-38X; 120-436-885-507-245; 121-811-412-873-104; 122-811-617-538-744; 125-776-085-466-37X; 127-053-448-450-830; 134-862-920-223-070; 144-013-805-730-372; 149-391-939-468-55X; 149-399-346-227-183; 155-138-749-023-240; 163-693-684-972-092; 173-072-232-205-686; 173-834-644-222-341; 173-889-457-735-668; 174-685-171-957-400; 184-261-773-220-661; 184-462-136-906-231; 190-524-744-036-450,168

The experiment consisted of seven treatments: control soil(CK), soil amended with 300℃(RB300), 400℃(RB400) and 500℃(RB500) rice straw biochar, soil incorporated with 300℃(CB300), 400℃(CB400) and 500℃(CB500) corn straw biochar. 【Result】 Feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature had a significant influence on the nutrient contents and chemical properties of biochar products. Compared with control, the two straw biochar amendments increased p H value by 0.16 unit and enhanced the contents of soil organic carbon, available P and available K by 26.1%, 20.6% and 281.8%, respectively. Under the same pyrolysis temperature, the application of rice straw biochar mainly promoted the level of available K while corn straw biochar improved the content of available P. Application of 300℃ straw biochar had no significant effect on soil available and mineral N contents. Compared with the control, soils amended with RB500 and CB500 were, respectively, 10.4% and 8.1% less in available N, while significantly increased by 63.6% and 100.7% in NO3--N concentration. Although the concentrations of microbial biomass carbon and total phospholipid fatty acids for soils amended with straw biochar were 63.4% and 47.5% higher than control soil, there was no significant difference between the control soil and soils with 300℃straw biochar. Both the two types of biochar enhanced the contents of G-, G+, fungi and actinobacteria and shown as 300℃400℃500℃. Results of PCA indicated that rice straw biochar amendment had more effect on the structure of soil microbial community than corn straw biochar. The microbial community compositions of three rice straw biochar were separated from each other while no distinctive recognized among the three corn biochar. Results of CCA suggested that straw biochars can affect the composition of microbial community through altering soil chemical and nutrient properties, as soil available P, soil organic carbon and available had significant correlation with the distribution of soil microbial community. 【Conclusion】 Both the two straw biochars could ameliorate the acidity and nutrient content of red paddy soil, and enhance the level of soil microbial biomass. Soil microbial community structure had been affected in the presence of straw biochars and rice straw biochar had more effective influence than corn straw biochars.",,,,,Nutrient; Soil water; Materials science; Amendment; Biomass; Straw; Soil carbon; Biochar; Agronomy; Microbial population biology,,,,,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-ZNYK201507011.htm,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-ZNYK201507011.htm,,,2350944623,,0,,3

Biochar N bioavailability and effect of biochar on fertilizer nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) were studied by 15N-enriched wheat biochar (7.8803 atom% 15N) and fertilizer urea (5.0026 atom% 15N) (Experiment I). Corn biochar and corn stalks were applied at 12 Mg ha−1 to study their effects on GHG emissions (Experiment II). Biochar had no significant impact on rice production and less than 2 % of the biochar N was available to plants in the first season. Biochar addition increased soil C and N contents and decreased urea NUE. Seasonal cumulative CH4 emissions with biochar were similar to the controls, but significantly lower than the local practice of straw amendment. N2O emissions with biochar were similar to the control in the acidic Ultisol, but significantly higher in the slightly alkaline Inceptisol. Carbon-balance calculations found no major losses of biochar-C. Low bio-availability of biochar N did not make a significantly impact on rice production or N nutrition during the first year.

This has led to numerous studies on the use of biochar to either bind or stimulate the microbial degradation of organic compounds in soils. However, very little or no attention have been paid to the fact that biochars can give simultaneous impact on PAH fate processes, such as volatilization, sorption and biodegradation. In this review, we raised and considered the following questions: How does biochar affect microbes and microbial activities in the soil? What are the effects of adding biochar on sorption of PAHs? What are the effects of adding biochar on degradation of PAHs? What are the factors that we can manipulate in the laboratory to enhance the capability of biochars to degrade PAHs? A triphasic concept of how biochar can give simultaneous impact on PAH fate processes in soils was proposed, which involves rapid PAH sorption into biochar, subsequent desorption and modification of soil physicochemical properties by biochar, which in turn stimulates microbial degradation of the desorbed PAHs. It is anticipated that biochar can give simultaneous impact on PAH fate processes in soils.",22,5,3314,3341,Environmental chemistry; Biodegradation; Soil water; Desorption; Chemistry; Microbial biodegradation;

008-586-407-623-843,"The Role of Biochar in Regulating the Carbon, Phosphorus, and Nitrogen Cycles Exemplified by Soil Systems",2021-05-18,2021,journal article,Sustainability,20711050,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Shu-Yuan Pan; Cheng Di Dong; Jenn Feng Su; Po Yen Wang; Chiu Wen Chen; Jo Shu Chang; Hyunook Kim; Chin-Pao Huang; Chang-Mao Hung,"Biochar is a carbon-rich material prepared from the pyrolysis of biomass under various conditions. Recently, biochar drew great attention due to its promising potential in climate change mitigation, soil amendment, and environmental control. Obviously, biochar can be a beneficial soil amendment in several ways including preventing nutrients loss due to leaching, increasing N and P mineralization, and enabling the microbial mediation of N2O and CO2 emissions. However, there are also conflicting reports on biochar effects, such as water logging and weathering induced change of surface properties that ultimately affects microbial growth and soil fertility. Despite the voluminous reports on soil and biochar properties, few studies have systematically addressed the effects of biochar on the sequestration of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in soils. Information on microbially-mediated transformation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) species in the soil environment remains relatively uncertain. A systematic documentation of how biochar influences the fate and transport of carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen in soil is crucial to promoting biochar applications toward environmental sustainability. This report first provides an overview on the adsorption of carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen species on biochar, particularly in soil systems. Then, the biochar-mediated transformation of organic species, and the transport of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in soil systems are discussed. This review also reports on the weathering process of biochar and implications in the soil environment. Lastly, the current knowledge gaps and priority research directions for the biochar-amended systems in the future are assessed.

Adsorption capacities of unmodified biochars for As(V) were low, but Fe(III) modification considerably enhanced As(V) adsorption by the biochars.

008-750-385-863-580,Challenging the claims on the potential of biochar to mitigate climate change,,2015,,,,,,T. Francischinelli Rittl,"Summary In this PhD thesis I studied the influence of biochar discourses on the political practices in Brazil and the impact of biochar on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, thus contributing to the current debate on the potential of biochar to mitigate climate change. Biochar is the solid material obtained from the carbonization of biomass. The deliberate production and application to soil distinguishes biochar from other carbonized products, e.g. charcoal. Inspired by the aged charcoal found in the fertile Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE; also known as Terra Preta de Indio), the current application of biochar in soil is claimed to simultaneously address four global challenges: food production, climate change, energy supply and waste reduction (Chapter 1). Biochar is supposed to be an absorbent and stable material, which can be used to retain nutrients in the soil, increasing agricultural productivity, while sequestering carbon over extended periods of time. Therefore, biochar is claimed to be a means to mitigate global climate change. Furthermore, if biochar is produced in a modern pyrolysis plant, it also can co-produce bio-oil and syngas that could be used as energy. And if biochar is produced by carbonization of agricultural residue, biochar may reduce the quantity of solid waste that needs to be disposed of. In Chapter 2, I analysed the policy arrangement related to biochar along the four dimensions of the policy arrangement approach, which are actors, discourse, power and rules. I focused on Brazil, which is an important player in the international biochar debate. My analysis shows that scientists in research institutions are the dominant players in the network, while policymakers, businessmen and farmers are marginally positioned. Experts from Embrapa occupy central positions and thus exercise most power in the network. Moreover, experts linked to ADE have lost prominence in the network. The cause for this reduction was the shift from the ADE/biochar to the biochar/technology discourse. The latter discourse includes different coalitions, such as: ‘climate change mitigation’, ‘improvement of soil fertility’ and ‘improving crop residue management’. Although the biochar/climate coalition is dominant at international level, it is far less prominent in Brazil. Nationally the discourses of ‘improvement of soil fertility’ and ‘improving crop residue management’ have particularly prompted actors’ relationships and practices. However, the biochar/technology discourse is not (yet) institutionalized into formal rules in Brazil. As a consequence, the country lacks an established biochar policy field. Brazilian biochar practices focus on the carbonization of the available residues into biochar and on the application of biochar in soils to increase the SOC content and consequently the fertility of these soils. In this context, in Chapter 3 I tested in the field the potential of biochar produced in traditional kilns to increase the C contents of sandy savannah soils. My results show that biochar produced in traditional kilns is less thermally altered than that produced by industrial kilns and therefore rapidly decomposes. The decomposition rate of traditionally produced biochar was higher (decomposition constant k = 0.32-1.00 year-1) than generally assumed (k = 0.0005-0.005 year-1), and higher than the decomposition of native SOC (k = 0.22 year-1). In Chapter 4 I demonstrated in a short-term laboratory experiment that oilseed-derived biochar had a similar or higher decomposition rate than native SOC. My results show that all three tested oilseed biochars decelerate the decomposition of SOC in the biochar-amended soils, with biochar richer in aromatics having a stronger negative effect than biochar richer in aliphatics. Therefore, oilseed biochar directly increases soil C stocks and indirectly raises soil C sequestration in the short term through decreasing the decomposition of native SOC. In my research, the decomposition studies were performed using 13C isotope analysis. However, the 13C isotope analysis cannot be used when the differences of 13C isotope abundance between biochar and soil are not sufficiently large. Therefore, its use can be limited. In Chapter 5, I aimed at improving the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method. I re-designed the protocols of the BPCA method and found a better and faster way to quantify and characterize the BPCAs derived from biochar, compared to the previous protocols. The improved method was then successfully tested and implemented in a laboratory in Brazil. Combining my findings with results of the literature, I conclude (Chapter 6) that there is no evidence that biochar is a reliable way for C sequestration in sandy soils under savannah environments. Biochar decomposition is highly variable, depending on charring conditions, soil and climate: (i) biochar produced by traditional kilns is less thermally degraded than those pyrolysed by industrial kilns; (ii) in sandy soils less biochar accumulates than in clay-silt soils; and (iii) warm-dry conditions raise the decomposition of biochar. These conclusions have a direct consequence for the development of policies on biochar, because we cannot ensure that biochar will sequester the same quantity of C for the same period at different geographical regions.",,,,,Terra preta; Slash-and-char; Crop residue; Context (language use); Soil fertility; Environmental science; Soil carbon; Charcoal; Environmental protection; Biochar; Agronomy,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F488988 http://edepot.wur.nl/346239 https://edepot.wur.nl/346239 http://www.alice.cnptia.embrapa.br/handle/doc/1034767 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/488988,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F488988,,,2561379788,,0,,0

Due to the good physical and chemical properties of biochar, including its rough porous structure, it has been widely used to absorb pollutants from water. Magnetic biochar is commonly prepared by combining biochar with magnetic material. The biochar is endowed with the characteristics of the magnetic material, which could effectively solve the problems of difficult recovery and easy loss of adsorbent in water treatment.

Processes & impacts,20507895; 20507887,Royal Society of Chemistry,United Kingdom,Yuchi Zhong; Avanthi Deshani Igalavithana; Ming Zhang; Xiaodian Li; Jörg Rinklebe; Deyi Hou; Filip Tack; Daniel S. Alessi; Daniel C.W. Tsang; Yong Sik Ok,"Biochar is an effective amendment for trace metal/metalloid (TMs) immobilization in soils. The capacity of biochar to immobilize TMs in soil can be positively or negatively altered due to the changes in the surface and structural chemistry of biochar after soil application. Biochar surfaces are oxidized in soils and induce structural changes through physical and biochemical weathering processes. These changes in the biochar surface and structural chemistry generally increase its ability to immobilize TMs, although the generation of dissolved black carbon during weathering may increase TM mobility. Moreover, biochar modification can improve its capacity to immobilize TMs in soils. Over the short-term, engineered/modified biochar exhibited increased TM immobilization capacity compared with unmodified biochar. In the long-term, no large distinctions in such capacities were seen between modified and unmodified biochars due to weathering. In addition, artificial weathering at laboratories also revealed increased TM immobilization in soils. Continued collection of mechanistic evidence will help evaluate the effect of natural and artificial weathering, and biochar modification on the long-term TM immobilization capacity of biochar with respect to feedstock and synthesis conditions in contaminated soils.",22,9,1790,1808,Environmental chemistry; Soil water; Chemistry; Raw material; Trace metal; Amendment; Weathering; Charcoal; Biochar; Metalloid,,Charcoal; Metalloids/chemistry; Metals/chemistry; Soil; Soil Pollutants/analysis,Metalloids; Metals; Soil; Soil Pollutants; biochar; Charcoal,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Research Foundation of Korea,http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/em/d0em00057d https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32789328/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789328 https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/em/d0em00057d https://koreauniv.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/effects-of-aging-and-weathering-on-immobilization-of-trace-metals https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/publications/effects-of-aging-and-weathering-on-immobilization-of-trace-metals https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8711845,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0em00057d,32789328,10.1039/d0em00057d,3048039178,,0,001-161-720-599-802; 001-298-202-769-979; 001-554-014-584-678; 001-868-214-685-942; 002-840-818-793-33X; 003-212-120-021-097; 003-905-809-818-882; 004-329-389-242-787; 005-031-597-696-577; 005-039-203-336-824; 005-833-274-561-453; 005-920-948-966-242; 006-121-331-752-960; 006-562-344-179-044; 006-978-371-844-520; 008-233-151-199-722; 008-795-580-345-008; 008-873-310-308-216; 008-899-917-069-050; 009-087-026-365-764; 009-165-006-816-493; 009-209-355-666-907; 010-940-268-368-985; 011-359-620-404-293; 011-971-391-406-770; 012-078-978-268-279; 013-410-962-152-94X; 013-765-348-108-132; 013-768-461-982-511; 013-860-507-462-709; 014-458-018-352-497; 015-046-011-301-756; 016-164-478-595-085; 017-843-626-412-553; 017-954-183-640-97X; 018-121-282-097-060; 018-873-517-589-812; 019-150-844-209-503; 020-022-025-991-561; 022-334-846-527-323; 022-379-785-207-850; 022-566-630-111-356; 022-852-797-639-969; 022-940-890-851-796; 023-306-869-494-753; 023-517-430-295-395; 024-000-253-443-848; 024-023-942-414-438; 025-226-733-244-977; 025-306-354-387-310; 025-581-711-298-33X; 026-069-042-011-920; 026-440-029-252-483; 028-129-125-110-662; 028-495-784-561-838; 028-591-039-685-355; 028-996-432-907-562; 029-187-335-871-402; 030-289-891-659-94X; 030-424-390-113-112; 031-179-915-444-193; 031-500-808-473-632; 032-653-668-609-051; 032-784-355-726-599; 034-588-855-658-419; 035-376-418-878-634; 036-363-058-587-078; 037-199-684-511-518; 037-424-589-579-74X; 037-596-656-141-969; 038-138-209-472-190; 039-295-271-706-125; 039-428-500-188-891; 039-988-834-330-208; 040-461-747-381-925; 040-727-278-333-300; 043-525-382-384-638; 043-629-015-910-073; 044-532-191-886-16X; 044-722-337-718-183; 046-182-602-987-80X; 048-116-509-887-668; 048-135-632-461-447; 048-218-623-496-246; 048-477-599-580-320; 048-569-712-416-484; 049-210-907-648-758; 049-225-452-457-972; 050-034-035-930-726; 051-117-719-455-276; 051-415-852-202-249; 052-240-190-743-947; 052-481-297-359-387; 053-487-424-262-38X; 054-087-492-189-771; 054-682-202-130-314; 054-879-041-435-270; 056-060-501-273-08X; 057-581-767-389-813; 057-992-794-016-939; 059-681-407-612-410; 061-095-289-443-416; 061-206-923-970-272; 062-710-603-262-639; 063-258-190-599-505; 063-929-521-180-990; 065-281-086-727-480; 066-470-408-819-417; 066-688-856-005-195; 066-994-485-567-329; 067-969-789-856-498; 068-106-702-161-443; 068-524-755-846-341; 068-781-169-459-602; 068-944-393-652-849; 069-485-673-266-754; 071-096-667-564-23X; 071-242-952-806-704; 071-400-089-018-491; 073-724-618-363-367; 075-236-050-916-909; 075-438-259-527-790; 076-587-188-133-174; 080-444-113-859-516; 081-241-056-562-586; 082-233-263-019-750; 083-355-719-305-07X; 087-457-318-890-469; 087-918-833-895-722; 088-799-317-857-612; 089-140-142-941-433; 090-854-917-981-933; 092-486-783-665-48X; 093-397-253-301-138; 093-876-546-346-215; 094-596-365-224-470; 096-859-101-812-097; 102-343-278-879-076; 104-520-892-025-959; 104-809-609-597-503; 105-690-453-890-949; 106-118-128-325-97X; 112-497-974-413-936; 113-385-810-039-415; 114-541-024-137-411; 116-323-077-694-163; 118-584-828-722-064; 120-308-106-564-958; 126-287-697-944-167; 126-554-945-151-70X; 126-878-997-348-783; 128-509-512-702-094; 128-987-516-708-342; 131-955-619-195-465; 132-526-183-553-313; 132-564-410-331-671; 145-937-154-458-788; 146-156-236-238-951; 146-340-997-059-261; 148-688-707-279-101; 152-128-979-412-796; 154-962-515-584-01X; 155-085-347-447-132; 163-693-684-972-092; 165-624-233-293-422; 197-613-726-447-781,14

Johnson; Dapeng Jing,"Little is known about the stability of biochar anion exchange capacity (AEC) and by what mechanisms AEC changes as biochar ages and weathers in soil environments. The goal of this study was to investigate chemical changes that may occur during ageing of biochar in neutral or alkaline soils and to assess the impact of ageing on AEC. To simulate and accelerate ageing, biochars were oxidized in alkaline hydrogen peroxide for 4 months. Spectroscopic evidence (FTIR, XPS and13C-NMR) revealed that ageing increased carbonyl and alcoholic character in biochars produced at 500 °C and effected endoperoxide formation in biochars produced at 700 °C; the latter exhibited greater arene carbon character. Ageing caused biochar AEC to decline on average by 54% with greater decreases in biochars produced at 500 °C in contrast to biochars produced at 700 °C. The AEC of biochar derived from alfalfa meal and cellulose produced at 700 °C did not change significantly (p = 0.20 and p = 0.50, respectively) with ageing. Stability of AEC in the high temperature biochars is attributed to the presence of oxonium groups in bridging positions of arene carbon, which are sterically resistant to nucleophilic attack.",103,,217,227,Environmental chemistry; Ion exchange; Accelerated aging; Alkali soil; Organic chemistry; Materials science; Cellulose; Ageing; Carbon; Hydrogen peroxide; Biochar,,,,Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive; National Institute of Food and Agriculture; Global Climate and Energy Project; National Science Foundation,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5595570 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622316301853,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.02.096,,10.1016/j.carbon.2016.02.096,2295328472,,0,002-013-732-772-213; 002-457-457-465-338; 002-840-818-793-33X; 004-922-010-866-120; 009-254-457-565-800; 010-297-586-156-662; 010-382-720-313-750; 012-811-733-068-868; 014-147-066-222-699; 015-494-652-270-629; 015-855-393-553-624; 016-164-478-595-085; 016-216-493-472-94X; 018-036-205-107-812; 022-298-423-402-240; 025-539-123-259-300; 026-181-588-779-27X; 028-671-193-280-145; 030-524-037-755-921; 031-859-423-025-223; 033-144-553-255-952; 037-507-420-213-041; 038-260-251-181-038; 046-771-695-861-143; 051-737-250-166-385; 055-796-951-753-027; 060-615-383-698-562; 062-710-603-262-639; 068-100-481-675-004; 071-480-400-593-951; 090-068-557-901-478; 111-932-241-049-142; 112-952-448-732-509; 121-772-645-204-99X; 125-776-085-466-37X; 130-843-773-283-778; 140-739-439-028-643; 152-965-251-496-673; 185-756-133-369-362; 193-035-856-960-738,61

White,"Biochar is seeing increased usage as an amendment in agricultural soils but the significance of nanoscale interactions between this additive and engineered nanoparticles (ENP) remains unknown. Corn, lettuce, soybean and zucchini were grown for 28 d in two different soils (agricultural, residential) amended with 0–2000 mg engineered nanoparticle (ENP) CeO2 kg−1 and biochar (350 °C or 600 °C) at application rates of 0–5% (w/w). At harvest, plants were analyzed for biomass, Ce content, chlorophyll and lipid peroxidation. Biomass from the four species grown in residential soil varied with species and biochar type. However, biomass in the agricultural soil amended with biochar 600 °C was largely unaffected. Biochar co-exposure had minimal impact on Ce accumulation, with reduced or increased Ce content occurring at the highest (5%) biochar level. Soil-specific and biochar-specific effects on Ce accumulation were observed in the four species. For example, zucchini grown in agricultural soil with 2000 mg CeO2 kg−1 and 350 °C biochar (0.5–5%) accumulated greater Ce than the control. However, for the 600 °C biochar, the opposite effect was evident, with decreased Ce content as biochar increased. A principal component analysis showed that biochar type accounted for 56–99% of the variance in chlorophyll and lipid peroxidation across the plants. SEM and μ-XRF showed Ce association with specific biochar and soil components, while μ-XANES analysis confirmed that after 28 d in soil, the Ce remained largely as CeO2. The current study demonstrates that biochar synthesis conditions significantly impact interactions with ENP, with subsequent effects on particle fate and effects.",110,,147,157,Soil water; Plant physiology; Chemistry; Chlorophyll; Amendment; Biomass; Soil Pollutants; Charcoal; Biochar; Agronomy,Agricultural crops; Biochar; CeO2 ENPs; Engineered nanoparticles; Synchrotron; Toxicity,"Agriculture/methods; Biomass; Cerium/chemistry; Charcoal/chemistry; Chlorophyll/metabolism; Crops, Agricultural/chemistry; Cucurbita/chemistry; Lettuce/chemistry; Lipid Peroxides/metabolism; Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Soil/chemistry; Soil Pollutants/chemistry; Soybeans/chemistry; Species Specificity; X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy; X-Ray Diffraction; Zea mays/chemistry",Lipid Peroxides; Soil; Soil Pollutants; biochar; Chlorophyll; Charcoal; Cerium; ceric oxide,US Department of Agriculture NIFA AFRI; Nanotechnology for Agricultural and Food Systems Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27288265 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5268237 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0981942816302248 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20173062250 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27288265/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0981942816302248 https://air.unipr.it/handle/11381/2840991,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.06.003,27288265,10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.06.003,2413170505,,0,001-020-299-979-027; 002-873-475-102-613; 003-273-955-910-65X; 003-541-942-398-296; 003-591-666-328-19X; 005-653-683-587-453; 007-609-280-687-358; 008-068-320-957-947; 010-566-404-188-376; 011-623-571-078-961; 013-410-962-152-94X; 014-617-187-324-425; 015-100-105-742-709; 016-913-041-901-081; 017-242-912-977-527; 017-376-920-296-952; 017-472-433-479-911; 020-166-876-373-692; 020-312-209-688-255; 021-345-985-322-86X; 022-463-639-723-584; 023-074-606-680-650; 023-820-889-770-497; 025-358-853-633-787; 026-005-742-071-112; 026-858-141-553-583; 029-121-152-912-29X; 029-380-186-193-357; 029-823-503-779-520; 039-861-120-758-714; 044-925-896-237-183; 045-867-955-326-949; 047-745-775-860-172; 048-884-775-484-193; 051-624-780-881-553; 051-871-045-996-643; 053-498-910-633-573; 054-426-570-732-738; 056-318-274-129-568; 056-938-610-680-680; 059-591-475-116-743; 061-784-487-584-934; 061-865-432-133-815; 063-521-134-816-136; 068-765-900-869-812; 070-335-310-345-682; 074-183-158-880-87X; 081-905-138-169-613; 084-724-376-137-170; 088-505-587-907-61X; 101-727-199-120-56X; 118-844-011-985-95X; 119-801-808-185-147; 122-075-683-082-674; 123-125-385-542-547; 129-802-098-961-435; 144-439-690-785-32X; 155-029-182-749-821; 178-079-944-974-41X,38

The optimum conditions of the pyrolysis processes were determined using response surface methodology. Comparison of the P removal efficiency of these two biochars under optimum conditions imply the superior adsorption capability of Ca-rich biochar. According to XRD analysis, calcite is the dominant mineral on the biochar surface, indicating the potential of Ca-rich biochar for P removal by adsorption and precipitation.

Landis,"Abstract The application of biochar to treat mercury (Hg) in the environment is being proposed on an increasing basis due to its widespread availability and cost effectiveness. However, the efficiency of Hg removal by biochars is variable due to differences in source material composition. In this study, a series of batch tests were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of sulfurized biochars (calcium polysulfide and a dimercapto-related compound, respectively) for Hg removal; Hg-loaded biochars were then characterized using synchrotron-based techniques. Concentrations of Hg decreased by >99.5% in solutions containing the sulfurized biochars. Sulfur X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses indicate a polysulfur-like structure in polysulfide-sulfurized biochar and a thiol-like structure (shifted compared to dimercapto) in the dimercapto-sulfurized biochar. Micro-X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) mapping and confocal X-ray micro-fluorescence imaging (CXMFI) analyses indicate Hg is distributed primarily on the edges of sulfurized biochar and throughout unmodified biochar particles. Hg extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses show Hg in enriched areas is bound to chlorine (Cl) in the unmodified biochar and to S in sulfurized biochars. These results indicate that Hg removal efficiency is enhanced after sulfurization through the formation of strong bonds (Hg-S) with S-functional groups in the sulfurized biochars.",347,,114,122,Extended X-ray absorption fine structure; XANES; Nuclear chemistry; Chemistry; Polysulfide; Cost effectiveness; Sulfur; Mercury (element); Biochar; X-ray absorption spectroscopy,Biochar; Confocal X-ray micro-fluorescence imaging; Mercury; Polysulfur; X-ray absorption spectroscopy,"Charcoal/chemistry; Mercury/chemistry; Sulfides/chemistry; Water Pollutants, Chemical/chemistry; Water Purification/methods; X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy","Sulfides; Water Pollutants, Chemical; biochar; Charcoal; Mercury","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); E.

Wallace; Frédérique Reverchon; Lukas Van Zwieten,"This study aimed to evaluate the improvement in soil fertility and plant nutrient use in a macadamia orchard following biochar application. The main objectives of this study were to assess the effects of poultry litter and green waste biochar applications on nitrogen (N) cycling using N isotope composition (δ15N) and nutrient availability in a soil-plant system at a macadamia orchard, 5 years following application. Biochar was applied at 10 t ha−1 dry weight but concentrated within a 3-m diameter zone when trees were planted in 2007. Soil and leaf samples were collected in 2012, and both soil and foliar N isotope composition (δ15N) and nutrient concentrations were assessed. Both soil and foliar δ15N increased significantly in the poultry litter biochar plots compared to the green waste biochar and control plots. A significant relationship was observed between soil and plant δ15N. There was no influence of either biochars on foliar total N concentrations or soil NH4;  +-N and NO3;  −-N, which suggested that biochar application did not pose any restriction for plant N uptake. Plant bioavailable phosphorus (P) was significantly higher in the poultry litter biochar treatment compared to the green waste biochar treatment and control. We hypothesised that the bioavailability of N and P content of poultry litter biochar may play an important role in increasing soil and plant δ15N and P concentrations. Biochar application affected soil-plant N cycling and there is potential to use soil and plant δ15N to investigate N cycling in a soil-biochar-tree crop system. The poultry litter biochar significantly increased soil fertility compared to the green waste biochar at 5 years following biochar application which makes the poultry litter a better feedstock to produce biochar compared to green waste for the tree crops.",22,5,3803,3809,Nutrient; Slash-and-char; Poultry litter; Amendment; Green waste; Orchard; Soil fertility; Environmental science; Biochar; Agronomy,,Agriculture/methods; Animals; Charcoal; Fertilizers; Macadamia/chemistry; Manure; Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis; Phosphorus/metabolism; Plant Leaves/chemistry; Poultry; Soil/chemistry; Time Factors,Fertilizers; Manure; Nitrogen Isotopes; Soil; biochar; Charcoal; Phosphorus,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11356-014-3649-2 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.springer-45fb75bb-6986-3ee7-b936-60d04042c49a https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25266060 https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/65131 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/25266060,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3649-2,25266060,10.1007/s11356-014-3649-2,2006231563,,0,000-126-481-803-377; 002-369-949-304-303; 003-514-606-393-046; 004-457-296-040-066; 005-064-080-156-798; 007-159-731-641-426; 007-403-798-453-456; 019-697-614-617-578; 023-958-297-181-850; 028-897-047-783-459; 030-382-287-804-107; 030-553-054-957-966; 033-990-797-843-681; 034-010-237-534-469; 035-834-367-657-684; 035-881-737-687-728; 036-556-806-041-099; 038-218-764-692-088; 039-071-152-038-424; 041-951-102-851-326; 042-557-140-240-068; 049-433-412-200-861; 058-257-869-680-996; 058-835-522-762-492; 061-732-359-184-018; 067-541-204-977-677; 077-522-438-618-57X; 080-444-080-431-336; 081-965-203-455-443; 085-560-907-942-995; 085-849-478-302-240; 102-819-232-224-630; 107-525-011-646-619; 107-700-538-900-332; 108-098-128-477-778; 110-379-437-278-257; 114-893-050-764-928; 121-142-433-351-131; 122-504-521-878-680; 127-032-514-186-247; 131-959-495-752-693; 133-588-704-054-481; 155-753-006-101-302; 165-720-948-967-582; 174-685-171-957-400; 175-158-613-513-48X; 177-905-751-511-932; 181-098-723-260-538,54

However, no relevant review study is available for East Asian countries which are responsible for 70% of gaseous N losses from croplands globally. This review analyzed data of the biochar-induced N2O mitigation affected by experimental conditions, including experimental types, biochar types and application rates, soil properties, and chemical forms and application rates of N fertilizer for East Asian countries. The magnitude of biochar-induced N2O mitigation was evaluated by calculating N2O reduction index (Rindex, percentage reduction of N2O by biochar relative to control). The Rindex was further standardized against biochar application rate by calculating Rindex per unit of biochar application rate (ton ha−1) (Unit Rindex). The Rindex averaged across different experimental types (n = 196) was −21.1 ± 2.4%. Incubation and pot experiments showed greater Rindex than column and field experiments due to higher biochar application rate and shorter experiment duration. Feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature also affected Rindex; either bamboo feedstock or pyrolysis at > 400 °C resulted in a greater Rindex. The magnitude of Rindex also increased with increasing biochar rate. Soil properties did not affect Rindex when evaluated across all experimental types, but there was an indication that biochar decreased N2O emission more at a lower soil moisture level in field experiments. The magnitude of Rindex increased with increasing N fertilizer rate up to 500–600 kg N ha−1, but it decreased thereafter. The Unit Rindex averaged across experimental types was −1.2 ± 0.9%, and it was rarely affected by experimental type and conditions but diminished with increasing biochar rate. Our results highlight that since N2O mitigation by biochar is affected by biochar application rate, Rindex needs to be carefully evaluated by standardizing against biochar application rate to suggest the best conditions for biochar usage in East Asia.",291,,118154,,Soil water; Raw material; Water content; Bamboo; Soil properties; Review study; Pyrolysis; Environmental science; Biochar; Agronomy,Biochar feedstock; Fertilizer application rate; N(2)O reduction Index; Pyrolysis temperature; Soil properties,Charcoal; Data Analysis; Nitrous Oxide/analysis; Soil,Soil; biochar; Charcoal; Nitrous Oxide,,https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_3343970 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974912101736X https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34537599/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118154,34537599,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118154,3199804230,,0,000-044-406-877-596; 000-518-315-845-793; 002-560-862-705-986; 002-731-293-073-248; 003-956-867-666-151; 004-457-296-040-066; 005-824-806-483-907; 006-321-627-556-906; 008-896-119-647-019; 014-208-747-507-178; 015-759-502-957-709; 017-586-960-426-18X; 020-871-299-612-553; 022-487-893-004-872; 022-811-822-344-046; 023-092-773-785-109; 023-734-641-891-147; 023-820-889-770-497; 027-492-715-742-037; 027-953-481-275-200; 028-763-086-814-218; 029-470-913-883-063; 029-580-624-703-780; 030-085-678-415-511; 031-340-481-076-976; 035-427-377-569-698; 035-561-495-416-016; 038-611-456-355-881; 038-819-681-651-014; 039-066-655-885-979; 039-071-152-038-424; 040-722-341-239-227; 040-823-637-587-792; 041-215-711-359-104; 042-141-838-159-334; 042-886-407-211-555; 043-644-192-665-457; 044-565-223-280-64X; 047-435-835-484-663; 049-182-595-659-056; 050-786-820-450-367; 052-595-984-911-749; 052-695-862-360-342; 053-015-726-352-57X; 053-434-032-920-751; 055-369-350-071-307; 060-836-962-115-543; 062-251-562-841-115; 063-141-893-182-571; 064-553-462-835-531; 066-415-629-455-82X; 067-023-899-533-65X; 070-199-808-201-658; 071-242-952-806-704; 071-321-855-676-667; 073-178-168-056-232; 076-941-259-729-047; 077-279-632-991-098; 079-967-543-826-922; 080-210-788-279-016; 080-946-358-612-829; 087-511-814-264-111; 088-417-183-666-071; 091-555-127-134-621; 092-556-007-117-078; 097-724-935-616-330; 099-978-643-589-695; 101-181-644-957-455; 103-402-675-201-297; 103-985-443-931-503; 114-126-075-748-134; 119-572-790-277-820; 119-747-570-955-185; 131-981-305-331-224; 136-145-177-348-678; 141-536-875-928-548,1

The objective of this research was to assess the flammability characteristics of fast pyrolysis biochars with test methods EPA 1030 and ASTM 4982. Results indicated that biochar is a non-flammable substance when tested with EPA 1030 ignitability of solids. However, when tested with ASTM D4982, a fast screening method, biochars showed potential risks of flammability. However, the addition of 20-50% moisture reduced any flammability concern.&#x0D;; Fast pyrolysis biochar was more prone to be flammable than traditional charcoal and slow pyrolysis biochar tested in this study. Still, fast pyrolysis biochars presented lower flammability potential (ASTM 4982) in comparison to its precursor biomass. The flammability propagation measured with EPA 1030, had high correlations with oxygen content and surface area of the fast pyrolysis biochar. The combustion reaction of fast pyrolysis biochar is a flameless combustion process, with a slow burning rate, and most commonly exhibiting a hot ember smoldering propagation front.&#x0D;; This paper illustrates the necessity of performing recurring tests due to biochar’s intrinsic variability stemming from the different modes of production and feedstock used.</jats:p>",13,2,23,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18272/aci.v13i2.2314,,10.18272/aci.v13i2.2314,,,0,,0

Aged biochars have distinct physico-chemical and surface properties compared to non-aged biochar. The aged biochar proved to be useful soil amendment due to its improved elements contents and surface properties. The biochar aging process resulted in increased surface area and pore volume, as well as carbon and oxygen-containing functional groups (such as C=O, -COOH, O-C=O etc.) on its surface, which were also associated with the adsorption behavior of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP). The biochar aging increased the adsorption capacity of 2,4,6-TCP, which was maximum at pH 3.0. The 2,4,6-TCP adsorption capacity of aged-bush biochar (ABB) and aged-peanut shell biochar (APB) was increased by 1.0-11.0% and 7.4-38.8%, respectively compared with bush biochar (BB) and peanut shell biochar (PB) at the same initial concentration of 2,4,6-TCP. All biochars had similar 2,4,6-TCP desorption rates ranging from 33.2 to 73.3% at different sorption temperatures and times. The desorbed components were mainly 2,4,6-TCP and other degraded components, which were low in concentration with small molecule substance. The results indicated that the aged-biochar could be effective for the long-term remediation of naturally organic polluted soils.",11,1,4293,4293,"Environmental chemistry; Adsorption; Desorption; Chemistry; 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol; Amendment; Carbon; Environmental remediation; Biochar; Sorption",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://www.scilit.net/article/cdda7641af01d3012af6e877e36df398 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7900105 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33619317/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatSR..11.4293C/abstract https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82129-z https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82129-z.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33619317,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82129-z,33619317,10.1038/s41598-021-82129-z,3130133020,PMC7900105,0,005-054-774-320-709; 011-971-391-406-770; 018-121-282-097-060; 018-217-951-576-015; 018-590-866-090-657; 019-619-060-771-499; 020-030-700-688-102; 022-095-390-242-497; 024-451-788-310-569; 025-006-821-450-637; 032-428-327-759-085; 035-362-652-005-631; 039-324-778-204-060; 041-426-645-060-605; 042-833-240-929-696; 043-559-821-427-050; 045-028-557-671-352; 048-141-399-242-045; 049-925-326-111-61X; 051-756-478-499-016; 052-038-228-921-368; 063-114-610-552-12X; 065-190-197-606-143; 071-480-400-593-951; 078-064-443-474-436; 088-318-606-762-978; 089-140-142-941-433; 097-736-854-061-108; 103-089-696-787-399; 105-095-661-711-638; 108-188-515-856-857; 147-543-513-647-590,4

Yaashikaa; P. Senthil Kumar; Sunita Varjani; Anbalagan Saravanan,"There is an upsurge enthusiasm for utilizing biochar produced from waste-biomass in different fields, to address the most important ecological issues. This review is focused on an overview of remediating harmful contaminants utilizing biochar. Production of biochar utilizing various systems has been discussed. Biochar has received the consideration of numerous analysts in building up their proficiency to remediate contaminants. Process parameters are fundamentally answerable for deciding the yield of biomass. Biochar derived from biomass is an exceptionally rich wellspring of carbon produced from biomass utilizing thermal combustion. Activating biochar is another particular region for the growing utilization of biochar for expelling specific contaminations. Closed-loop systems to produce biochar creates more opportunities. Decentralized biochar production techniques serve as an effective way of providing employment opportunities, managing wastes, increasing resource proficiency in circular bioeconomy. This paper also covers knowledge gaps and perspectives in the field of remediation of toxic pollutants using biochar.",28,,e00570,,Carbon sequestration; Production (economics); Biomass; Environmental science; Environmental remediation; Waste management; Biochar,Biochar; Carbon sequestration; Circular bioeconomy; Pollutants removal; Production techniques,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33304842 https://doaj.org/article/bdcae0e0521a42d7b4089b7ee526bbbd https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215017X20300023 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33304842/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2020.e00570,33304842,10.1016/j.btre.2020.e00570,3107597821,PMC7718465,0,000-039-311-679-208; 000-049-694-414-176; 001-020-299-979-027; 001-355-385-354-167; 001-907-415-610-436; 001-945-727-196-585; 002-004-696-614-597; 002-023-033-989-447; 002-160-189-592-340; 002-175-489-923-553; 002-433-688-452-992; 002-562-838-970-025; 003-158-485-640-750; 003-544-870-384-277; 003-755-566-530-081; 003-942-726-047-325; 004-357-765-130-630; 004-784-716-743-381; 004-999-649-572-698; 005-519-979-387-322; 006-286-997-284-716; 007-321-836-456-633; 007-397-566-440-420; 008-087-024-893-305; 010-103-660-729-812; 013-465-055-853-046; 013-550-648-417-393; 014-724-644-293-024; 015-712-322-200-794; 015-818-626-255-909; 016-164-478-595-085; 016-897-084-232-378; 017-180-766-507-103; 018-588-437-210-136; 019-571-953-248-611; 019-616-626-799-789; 020-312-209-688-255; 021-155-526-760-214; 021-705-104-175-086; 021-754-863-383-231; 021-880-074-081-30X; 022-355-821-577-722; 022-383-131-631-275; 023-092-249-348-914; 023-168-310-550-766; 023-389-963-122-792; 024-282-338-548-292; 025-362-971-002-515; 025-846-748-589-246; 025-923-947-720-290; 025-928-448-211-742; 026-492-562-252-873; 026-892-533-483-982; 026-989-004-984-176; 027-260-581-890-081; 027-700-854-107-803; 027-717-039-104-367; 028-134-598-247-593; 028-375-237-639-441; 028-751-772-093-475; 031-532-258-035-06X; 032-653-668-609-051; 033-022-207-067-806; 033-749-392-140-557; 033-829-663-086-442; 033-967-967-810-837; 034-188-507-197-086; 034-306-105-554-84X; 034-622-411-165-935; 034-867-400-805-445; 035-948-000-004-64X; 036-363-058-587-078; 037-220-521-778-115; 037-631-229-093-684; 038-118-864-203-714; 038-596-994-586-828; 038-757-502-967-726; 040-976-944-322-249; 042-987-500-793-556; 043-574-430-693-47X; 044-790-479-874-581; 047-062-711-199-570; 048-827-250-083-652; 049-551-430-144-24X; 049-688-581-956-584; 049-851-176-453-905; 050-854-839-174-78X; 051-236-173-240-805; 051-262-914-309-304; 051-480-772-886-338; 052-147-746-677-29X; 055-510-399-214-68X; 056-372-320-661-369; 057-246-412-549-496; 057-625-221-733-215; 058-094-572-972-046; 059-992-292-094-171; 060-113-437-231-176; 060-194-778-933-114; 066-067-170-093-950; 068-609-916-273-840; 073-341-737-294-853; 075-566-508-614-69X; 076-682-387-337-95X; 077-037-590-203-388; 077-137-135-430-325; 079-430-292-697-950; 080-383-872-180-233; 082-404-571-442-036; 084-096-978-469-928; 084-333-076-920-966; 084-897-258-770-368; 087-877-755-569-56X; 091-925-856-698-334; 094-559-301-497-522; 101-571-880-727-612; 103-487-815-190-020; 107-178-594-919-338; 108-804-942-604-757; 110-389-718-302-654; 113-111-904-782-316; 113-982-718-462-232; 115-699-436-343-162; 117-065-730-811-922; 121-811-412-873-104; 121-917-114-530-571; 123-125-385-542-547; 124-443-708-023-988; 126-171-121-237-14X; 126-480-005-098-575; 127-942-696-807-528; 130-133-155-205-899; 130-897-534-280-979; 134-697-859-352-079; 135-997-016-466-984; 138-053-913-794-217; 140-375-477-774-474; 140-721-581-163-111; 144-701-003-089-359; 145-900-701-153-15X; 148-337-797-576-446; 149-391-939-468-55X; 149-562-652-790-588; 150-628-530-058-924; 161-464-319-712-573; 169-163-718-109-394; 173-834-644-222-341,70

Meinders; Cathelijne R. Stoof; T.M. Bezemer; T.F.J. Van de Voorde; Liesje Mommer; J.W. van Groenigen,"Abstract Biochar application to soil is currently being widely posited as a means to improve soil quality and thereby increase crop yield. Next to beneficial effects on soil nutrient availability and retention, biochar is assumed to improve soil water retention. However, evidence for such an effect in the primary literature remains elusive. Therefore, we studied the effect of biochar on soil hydrological characteristics in two separate field experiments on a sandy soil in The Netherlands. In Experiment I, biochar produced through slow pyrolysis of herbaceous feedstock at two temperatures (400 °C and 600 °C) was applied to soil at a rate of 10 t ha − 1 . In Experiment II, the 400 °C biochar was applied at rates of 1, 5, 20 and 50 t ha − 1 . Soils were analysed for soil water retention, aggregate stability and other soil physical parameters after three growing seasons and one growing season for Experiment I and Experiment II, respectively. We characterised the pore structure of the biochar using X-ray computed micro-tomography (XRT) and hydrophobicity using contact angle measurements. We found no significant effects of biochar application on soil water retention in either experiment. Aggregate stability was also not significantly affected, nor was field saturated hydraulic conductivity. XRT analysis of the biochars showed that they were highly porous, with 48% and 57% porosity for the 400 °C and 600 °C biochar respectively. More than 99% of internal pores of the biochar particles were connected to the surface, suggesting a potential role for biochars in improving soil water retention. However, the biochars were highly hydrophobic. We postulate that this strong hydrophobicity prevented water from infiltrating into the biochar particles, prohibiting an effect on soil water retention. Our results suggest that, in addition to characterising pore space, biochars should be analysed for hydrophobicity when assessing their potential for improving soil physical properties.",251,,47,54,Growing season; Soil science; Soil water; Soil quality; Pyrolysis; Environmental science; Charcoal; Biochar; Hydraulic conductivity; Porosity,,,,Emerging Science Fund of the Production Ecology and Resource Conservation (PE&RC); Marie Curie Career Integration,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015Geode.251...47J/abstract http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706115000993 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.knaw.nl%3Apublications%2Fb1595f23-9d9e-4cbb-8906-3e7a676de1bb https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/en/publications/biochar-application-does-not-improve-the-soil-hydrological-functi https://research.wur.nl/en/publications/biochar-application-does-not-improve-the-soil-hydrological-functi http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/486490 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706115000993,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.03.022,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.03.022,2119522390,,0,002-112-386-894-78X; 002-873-475-102-613; 007-377-208-649-699; 008-191-987-878-319; 008-292-995-907-514; 010-871-129-446-780; 011-364-663-695-365; 012-360-057-394-042; 012-815-180-747-868; 016-160-939-175-190; 016-387-447-337-663; 017-480-453-670-73X; 021-983-497-361-25X; 022-445-339-768-677; 022-710-227-296-251; 024-313-481-987-81X; 024-799-445-028-403; 028-818-825-858-288; 031-528-662-129-509; 033-022-207-067-806; 033-925-478-016-012; 036-945-276-054-341; 046-043-670-657-650; 048-961-983-264-255; 049-835-525-808-613; 055-050-502-702-231; 058-257-607-146-451; 062-584-446-185-03X; 067-761-064-991-876; 070-226-530-048-513; 070-353-050-266-126; 074-342-046-748-829; 076-248-350-391-889; 090-133-259-151-881; 104-513-340-688-839; 106-564-802-082-536; 106-693-719-816-704; 116-256-308-468-255; 117-126-875-331-205; 125-402-357-008-537; 143-707-496-421-903; 146-708-903-999-213; 164-524-435-292-415; 174-685-171-957-400; 176-781-944-238-823; 187-118-162-708-884,189

Sathe; Ravindra V. Adivarekar; Aniruddha B. Pandit,"Biochar is one of the significant soil amendments. A lot of research has already done in the field of biochar. But very few studies have mentioned the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the plant growth. To the best of our knowledge we have not yet come across any systematic study elaborating the effect of various pyrolysis temperature of coconut husk biochar on seed germination and plant growth. Therefore, the experiment was conducted during 2019 to 20 at Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai, India to explore the effect of coconut husk biochar produced at various pyrolysis temperatures (300, 400, 500 and 600°C) individually and along with the nitrogen fertilizer (urea) on the growth of sorghum. Maximum biochar yield of 54.67 % was obtained at 300°C. The ash content, pH, and EC (electrical conductivity) of biochar significantly increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature, maximum ash content (31.4 %), pH (9.9) and EC (2.48 mS/cm) were observed at 600°C pyrolysis temperature. Bulk density and nitrogen concentration of biochar reduced with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Highest nitrogen concentration of 0.62% was detected in biochar produced at 300°C. Surface area of the biochar increased with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature giving a surface area of 213.91 m2/g at 600 °C pyrolysis temperature. The germination percentage was adversely affected by the use of biochar and nitrogen fertilizer combination treatment. Maximum shoot and root biomass of sorghum were obtained with the use of biochar produced at 300°C. Similarly, plant height, leaf area and stem diameter were significantly high in the treatment containing biochar obtained at 300°C pyrolysis temperature. Nevertheless, combining biochar and nitrogen fertilizer had no synergic and summative effect on sorghum growth. The findings of the present study thus demonstrate that biochar obtained at low pyrolysis temperature can be a practical approach to enhance crop biomass growth and possibly yield.",55,,215,229,Germination; Horticulture; Soil conditioner; Chemistry; Sorghum; Biomass; Pyrolysis; Nitrogen; Biochar; Husk,,,,,https://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:cr1&volume=55&issue=5and6&article=005,https://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:cr1&volume=55&issue=5and6&article=005,,,3176615032,,0,,0

Apart from the impact of the AC/biochar dose, the influence of biochar particle diameter ( 500 μm) and the influence of the contact time (7, 60, 90 days) between AC/biochar and sewage sludges on their phytotoxicity was also assessed. No negative impact of sewage sludges on seed germination was observed (P>0.05). The application of AC or biochar to the sludges positively affected root growth by reducing the harmful effect by 7.8 to 42% depending on the material used. Furthermore, the reduction range clearly depended on the type of sewage sludge. No differences were observed in the inhibition of the toxic effect between both biochar types used and the biochar particle size. The extension of the contact time between AC/biochar and sewage sludges had a negative impact on root growth.",80,,321,326,Germination; Environmental chemistry; Chemistry; Particle size; Activated carbon; Phytotoxicity; Lepidium sativum; Biochar; Sewage; Sludge; Agronomy,,"Charcoal/chemistry; Environmental Restoration and Remediation/methods; Lepidium sativum/drug effects; Sewage/chemistry; Soil Pollutants/chemistry; Waste Disposal, Fluid/methods; Water Pollutants/chemistry",Sewage; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants; biochar; Charcoal,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651312001029 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22516757 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22516757 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:551884 http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:551884 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651312001029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.03.015,22516757,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.03.015,2039451645,,0,000-232-389-426-686; 008-068-320-957-947; 013-310-761-360-613; 017-472-433-479-911; 017-904-680-559-501; 020-834-719-642-01X; 021-141-342-162-394; 021-155-526-760-214; 022-445-339-768-677; 023-820-889-770-497; 038-094-355-629-545; 059-681-407-612-410; 061-728-097-587-658; 065-450-318-481-120; 065-604-257-704-632; 069-672-024-140-522; 077-830-859-252-451; 086-791-194-043-395; 087-298-738-675-452; 090-145-532-541-935; 092-067-119-179-436; 140-236-017-142-417,34
010-672-214-793-574,Can polyethylene passive samplers predict polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) uptake by earthworms and turnips in a biochar amended soil,2019-01-17,2019,journal article,The Science of the total environment,18791026; 00489697,Elsevier,Netherlands,Ludovica Silvani; Sigurbjörg Hjartardottir; Lucie Bielská; Lucia Škulcová; Gerard Cornelissen; Luca Nizzetto; Sarah E. Hale,"A pot experiment was carried out in which aged polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contaminated soil was amended with biochar, and three phases: earthworms, turnips and polyethylene (PE) passive samplers, were added simultaneously in order to investigate changes in bioavailability of PCB following biochar amendment. Two biochars were used: one made from rice husk in Indonesia using local techniques and the other made from mixed wood shavings using more advanced technology. The biochars were amended at 1 and 4% doses. The overall accumulation of PCBs to the phases followed the order: earthworm lipid > PE > turnip. The rice husk biochar reduced PCB accumulation to a greater degree than the mixed wood biochar for all phases, however there was no effect of dose for either biochar. Earthworm uptake was reduced between 52% and 91% for rice husk biochar and by 19% to 63% formix wood biochar. Turnip uptake was not significantly reduced by biochar amendment. Phase to soil accumulation factors (PSAF) were around 0.5 for turnips, approximately 5 for PE and exceeded 100 for earthworms. This study demonstrates that both biochars canbe a sustainable alternative for in situ soil remediation and that PE can be used as tool to simulate the uptake in earthworms and thus remediation effectiveness.
