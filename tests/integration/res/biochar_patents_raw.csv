The preparation technology comprises the following steps: pyrolyzing biomass to obtain biochar, and cooling the biohar; heating and melting urea to obtain molten urea; and fully mixing and infiltrating the cooled biochar and molten urea in proportion, and performing extrusion molding to obtain the biochar-based urea fertilizer. The agricultural waste biomass is pyrolyzed to obtain the biochar, and the biochar and urea are infiltrated at a certain temperature to obtain the long-acting environmentally-friendlyfertilizer. The infiltrated carbon fertilizer is fertilizer obtained by infiltrating and molding the molten urea and biochar according to a specific ratio. The molten urea has good fluidity, can quickly enter pores of the biochar, and makes the pores of the biochar fully filled with the molten urea in order to make the biochar have very strong adsorption capacity on urea, so the urea has the characteristic of long-acting effect in soil.
