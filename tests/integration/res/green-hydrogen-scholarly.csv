000-224-949-565-407,Solid Oxide Electrolyser Demonstrator Development at Elcogen,2021-07-23,2021,journal article,ECS Meeting Abstracts,21512043,The Electrochemical Society,,Timo Lehtinen; Matti Noponen,"<jats:p>  	Elcogen is a company providing solid oxide cell and stack solutions for fuel cell (SOFC) and electrolysis (SOEC) applications. Elcogen’s solutions are designed to operate at reduced operating temperatures but still providing high performance at affordable cost and low degradation level. Elcogen is currently expanding its manufacturing capabilities towards multi-MW annual production levels through a factory project. As a part of commercialization tasks, Elcogen is developing a demonstrator unit for steam electrolysis applications producing green hydrogen. This demonstrator unit is a part of an EU’s H2020 funded C2FUEL project. C2FUEL project aims to develop energy-efficient, economically and environmentally viable CO<jats:sub>2 </jats:sub>conversion technologies for the displacement of fossils fuels emission through a concept of industrial symbiosis between carbon intensive industries, power production, and local economy. The key technical and economic challenges to be tackled in the project are related to innovative production routes of dimethyl ether (DME) and formic acid (FA) from hydrogen (produced by Elcogen’s technology) and captured carbon dioxide. The C2FUEL concept will be demonstrated at Dunkirk industrial area between DK6 combined cycle power plant, Arcelor Mittal steel factory and one of the major European harbours.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>This presentation outlines the current progress of the high temperature electrolysis demonstrator development at Elcogen. The main advantage of high temperature solid oxide electrolysis technology compared to low temperature electrolysis technologies, i.e. polymer electrolyte membrane and alkaline, is its considerably higher electrical efficiency and thus reduced specific energy consumption. E.g. the specific energy consumption for a SOEC stack can be up to 25 - 45% better than for PEMEC and AEC technologies and even in complete system level SOEC technology can provide 15 – 45 % better efficiencies [1]. The electrolyser demonstrator unit is designed to deliver 1 Nm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/h of hydrogen at 40 bar. The electrolysis stack is Elcogen’s own technology and it is operated at about 700°C. The processes for steam and gas supply, and heat management are implemented with standard industrial components. The gas pressurizing is conducted with a mechanical compressor which has an inherent feature to produce pressure variation on the suction side. Minimization of this pressure variation is conducted with system level solutions. Prior the compression stage, hydrogen is dried in order to provide high quality hydrogen to the synthesis processes and to avoid water condensation in the pressurized components. The demonstrator is divided into two subsystems: electrolyser subsystem that produces atmospheric pressure hydrogen and compressor subsystem which compresses the produced hydrogen to 40 bar. The subsystems are designed modular and can be operated also freely from each other.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>This work has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 838014 (C2FUEL).</jats:p>;                <jats:p>References</jats:p>;                <jats:p>[1] O.Schmidt, A.

McCoy; Russell McKenna; Robert Pietzker; Arvind P. Ravikumar; Matteo C. Romano; Falko Ueckerdt; Jaap Vente; Mijndert van der Spek,"<jats:p>Natural gas based hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage is referred to as blue hydrogen. If substantial amounts of CO2 from natural gas reforming are captured and permanently stored, such hydrogen could be a low-carbon energy carrier. However, recent research raises questions about the effective climate impacts of blue hydrogen from a life cycle perspective. Our analysis sheds light on the relevant issues and provides a balanced perspective on the impacts on climate change associated with blue hydrogen. We show that such impacts may indeed vary over large ranges and depend on only a few key parameters: the methane emission rate of the natural gas supply chain, the CO2 removal rate at the hydrogen production plant, and the global warming metric applied. State-of-the-art reforming with high CO2 capture rates combined with natural gas supply featuring low methane emissions does indeed allow for substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to both conventional natural gas reforming and direct combustion of natural gas. Under such conditions, blue hydrogen is compatible with low-carbon economies and features climate change impacts in line with green hydrogen from electrolysis supplied with renewable electricity. However, neither current blue nor green hydrogen production pathways render fully “net-zero” hydrogen without additional carbon dioxide removal.</jats:p>",,,,,,,,,Canada First Research Excellence Fund,,http://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-hz0qp,,10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-hz0qp,,,0,,0

In addition to the high intrinsic activity determined by the electronic structure, electrocatalysts are also required to be capable of fast mass transfer (electrolyte recharge and bubble overflow) and high mechanical stability. Herein, the 2D CoOOH sheet-encapsulated Ni2P into tubular arrays electrocatalytic system was proposed and realized 1000 mA cm−2-level-current-density hydrogen evolution over 100 h in neutral water. In designed catalysts, 2D stack structure as an adaptive material can buffer the shock of electrolyte convection, hydrogen bubble rupture, and evolution through the release of stress, which insure the long cycle stability. Meanwhile, the rich porosity between stacked units contributed the good infiltration of electrolyte and slippage of hydrogen bubbles, guaranteeing electrolyte fast recharge and bubble evolution at the high-current catalysis. Beyond that, the electron structure modulation induced by interfacial charge transfer is also beneficial to enhance the intrinsic activity. Profoundly, the multiscale coordinated regulation will provide a guide to design high-efficiency industrial electrocatalysts.",12,1,140,140,Bubble; Materials science; Current density; Chemical engineering; Electrolysis of water; Mass transfer; Hydrogen; Porosity; Electrolyte; Stack (abstract data type),2D adaptive material; Interfacial charge modulation; Large-scale hydrogen production; Mass transport; Multiscale coordinated regulation,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40820-020-00476-4 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NML....12..140Z/abstract https://www.nmlett.org/index.php/nml/article/view/53 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7770877 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7770877 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34138122/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138122 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40820-020-00476-4.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40820-020-00476-4,34138122,10.1007/s40820-020-00476-4,3040095371,PMC7770877,0,002-994-477-923-90X; 006-426-622-726-76X; 007-206-794-463-080; 009-217-243-613-915; 009-404-952-063-964; 009-767-648-040-429; 011-461-886-663-20X; 011-924-681-851-387; 012-975-601-201-832; 017-447-719-503-740; 019-548-870-876-668; 019-997-748-475-370; 020-036-165-682-91X; 022-453-350-706-717; 022-981-080-362-852; 023-007-903-672-075; 024-550-616-578-503; 026-497-463-607-379; 028-171-521-944-561; 029-329-167-179-10X; 029-746-761-063-123; 031-132-673-791-775; 031-367-954-681-093; 034-397-710-350-139; 036-763-765-514-217; 038-139-196-972-229; 039-105-115-678-564; 044-201-031-992-901; 048-134-403-546-944; 048-595-874-347-580; 051-531-771-790-307; 053-136-822-716-178; 055-760-638-376-339; 056-709-910-146-181; 057-390-108-859-090; 060-439-181-570-122; 061-889-864-781-214; 062-333-947-594-302; 063-414-534-749-733; 065-700-959-798-848; 066-701-218-493-247; 069-900-000-430-519; 074-582-204-091-66X; 074-670-563-240-006; 077-055-900-689-707; 080-415-746-330-070; 082-983-846-229-963; 083-504-107-411-003; 085-138-129-588-235; 088-950-210-196-948; 089-614-449-868-746; 092-565-569-639-315; 094-003-015-795-584; 101-714-150-201-067; 103-792-622-634-685; 104-582-535-329-165; 110-347-931-125-276; 114-847-487-883-316; 127-593-276-101-294; 128-820-888-155-465; 141-904-634-292-864; 151-919-187-837-192; 177-496-491-367-529,39

Hydrogen has been known as one of the most plentiful elements in the universe, yet it solely appears as combined with other elements. Therefore, hydrogen production itself is an energy-intensive process and thus could generate significant amounts of CO2. Nevertheless, green hydrogen (produced from renewable resources) rapidly gaining interest as a key material in the decarbonisation of the energy sector and one of the promising solutions to tackle the global warming challenge. This work presents a framework for hydrogen and CO2 utilisation strategies in an industrial park while identifying optimum decisions related to the allocation of the feedstock through possible technologies to produce sustainable and low-cost hydrogen. A techno-economic optimization model based on a superstructure approach has been developed to identify the best possible hydrogen network configurations from a number of technologies, which is achieved by a combination of many possible hydrogen and CO2 utilisation scenarios.

Australia, with its abundant renewable resources and ample iron-ore deposits, is in an excellent position to participate in this opportunity. We highlight the synergies between the Australian iron-ore industry and the production of green-hydrogen from renewable energy sources. We identify high-potential areas for green steel production by cross-referencing regions of current and future iron-ore extraction against areas of high economic potential for hydrogen production. From these, we select two regions, the  Pilbara region of  North-Western  Australia and the  Eyre  Peninsula in  South  Australia, for more detailed case studies. The analysis highlights the advantages of a well-optimised generation mix (in terms of wind, solar, battery, grid connection and salt cavern storage, etc.) in decreasing storage requirements and the resulting production costs. We also demonstrate that green steel production costs could be reduced further if the system could use grid electricity to balance onsite renewable power by participating in the electricity spot market and operating flexibly.</jats:p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31223/x55h04,,10.31223/x55h04,,,0,,0

It is critical that the life cycle environmental impacts and net energy balance are assessed to ensure that solar-electrolysis can contribute to the deep decarbonisation of global energy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and net energy analysis (NEA) are tools for environmental and net energy assessment of such technologies. LCA/NEA studies of renewable hydrogen typically include simplifying assumptions, such as steady state operation under average conditions. Whilst simplifications may be necessary for preliminary analysis, marked differences arising from context specific variances and operating constraints may be overlooked. To address this gap, we conduct an LCA/NEA of a hypothetical large-scale solar-electrolysis plant, with a focus on operational sensitivities. We find the most significant component is the solar modules due to the materials and processes used in their manufacture. We find the most significant sensitivity stems from the electrolyser turndown and the commensurate need to buffer solar electricity with storage or grid electricity. Under baseline conditions, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are around one-quarter that of the currently dominant process for hydrogen production, steam methane reforming (SMR). However, sensitivity analysis shows that GHG emissions may be comparable to SMR under reasonably anticipated conditions. Net energy results are less than for fossil fuels and sufficiently uncertain to warrant further attention. We recommend that LCA and NEA are integrated with project planning to ensure that hydrogen meets the goals of green production.",14,10,5113,5131,Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Electricity; Life-cycle assessment; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Greenhouse gas; Photovoltaics; Fossil fuel; Environmental engineering,,,,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/ee/d1ee01288f#! http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/ee/d1ee01288f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ee01288f,,10.1039/d1ee01288f,3195481972,,0,001-100-899-802-233; 002-156-768-799-467; 003-168-883-243-83X; 008-977-598-832-370; 011-014-568-737-029; 014-373-150-062-689; 014-962-370-277-097; 017-961-648-972-698; 023-960-803-642-334; 024-857-992-842-060; 025-426-866-704-267; 026-749-946-597-310; 027-470-016-764-651; 027-596-367-277-189; 029-905-300-758-972; 030-755-289-167-77X; 031-593-625-192-120; 032-449-386-628-432; 033-773-123-910-760; 033-773-978-761-692; 034-045-831-087-235; 034-124-699-194-740; 034-793-596-097-057; 035-096-488-477-709; 035-698-629-532-299; 036-049-135-290-580; 036-117-304-491-669; 038-211-811-521-512; 038-267-288-653-192; 039-146-672-457-570; 045-247-630-000-740; 046-788-924-865-932; 050-385-654-527-551; 050-774-383-332-195; 053-060-957-546-403; 056-273-493-335-058; 056-279-135-406-204; 056-596-749-424-641; 056-634-670-988-238; 059-899-590-755-541; 060-831-707-223-288; 061-197-954-956-631; 061-523-575-424-871; 062-280-122-011-153; 062-619-287-438-219; 064-241-750-054-008; 070-471-751-284-519; 071-286-480-195-46X; 072-800-284-208-337; 074-672-894-421-45X; 079-785-991-031-51X; 081-448-364-116-172; 081-691-153-840-347; 086-460-346-414-970; 087-036-315-712-506; 097-232-478-765-670; 097-521-937-615-366; 098-168-092-611-591; 100-987-299-946-62X; 102-467-951-537-792; 103-173-947-734-956; 104-519-458-466-366; 107-031-900-973-986; 111-838-713-271-892; 118-697-656-319-527; 119-748-382-908-693; 121-090-610-623-766; 131-040-232-102-732; 133-701-987-848-557; 135-726-799-673-773; 143-688-831-324-852; 163-630-115-866-793; 165-405-138-331-742; 168-185-736-453-894; 183-173-308-769-695; 199-285-356-113-313,3
000-943-514-721-432,Invited) Overcoming Technological and Economic Barriers to Generating Renewable Hydrogen with Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Electrolysis,2020-05-01,2020,journal article,ECS Meeting Abstracts,21512043,The Electrochemical Society,,Cortney Mittelsteadt,"<jats:p>  	Water electrolysis, coupled with green energy sources has long held the promise for supplanting steam methane reforming, SMR, for hydrogen generation for ammonia and petroleum refining, together contributing a billion tons of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/year. Additionally hydrogen can be used as a store and carrier of energy for mobile and grid applications. Wide adoption has been prevented by unacceptable costs however, both capital and operating, the latter of which is dominated by the cost of the electricity. In those industrial applications where electrolysis has found a niche it has been dominated by liquid alkaline electrolysis, due to its long history of proven durability and low cost materials. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) has had the potential to operate at slightly higher efficiencies, and much higher current density, while allowing high, and more importantly, differential pressure. PEMEL’s reliance on precious group metal (PGM) catalysts as well as membrane lifetime concerns have generally left them to specialty applications where footprint is a premium, such as sea and space.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>A number of concurrent advancements are overcoming these barriers. First, and most importantly, the cost of energy has come down faster than anyone would have predicted. This cannot be over-emphasized, as will be shown, lowering the cost of renewables has done more for green hydrogen than anything that can be achieved by electrochemical scientists and engineers, as energy costs have long dominated the cost of green hydrogen. Further lowering costs will in turn change focus to capital costs and technology opportunities. Second, improvements in membrane stability has greatly increased the durability of PEMEL systems. This has improved the lifetime of the systems while also allowing more aggressive operating conditions of higher pressure, temperature and current density. The challenges and limitations of further increasing these parameters, as well as their impact on cost will be addressed. Finally, PGM catalyst loadings continue to decrease. This reduction, as well as the increase in lifetimes allows a far greater amount of hydrogen to be generated per gram of PGM catalyst.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>The last great barrier for PEMEL to achieve parity with SMR, and enable hydrogen for mobility and large scale energy storage is simply scale. PEMEL, and even alkaline electrolysis are at an infancy in terms of scale. As PEM systems grow from traditional 1-100 kW systems to the 1-100 MW systems necessary for mobility, storage and industrial uses the capital costs will come down tremendously. We will look at how low these costs can go as well as consider the scarcity limitation of PGMs as PEMEL increases capacity from current output of &lt; 100 MW/year to 10-100 GW/year necessary to make real impact in these applications.    </jats:p>",MA2020-01,42,1831,1831,Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis; Renewable energy; Materials science; Chemical engineering; Hydrogen,,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2020-01421831mtgabs,http://dx.doi.org/10.1149/ma2020-01421831mtgabs,,10.1149/ma2020-01421831mtgabs,3025247756,,0,,0

W. Adams; Y.-H. Percival Zhang,"Starch is a natural energy storage compound and is hypothesized to be a high-energy density chemical compound or solar fuel. In contrast to industrial hydrolysis of starch to glucose, an alternative ATP-free phosphorylation of starch was designed to generate cost-effective glucose 6-phosphate by using five thermophilic enzymes (i.e., isoamylase, alpha-glucan phosphorylase, 4-α-glucanotransferase, phosphoglucomutase, and polyphosphate glucokinase). This enzymatic phosphorolysis is energetically advantageous because the energy of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds among anhydroglucose units is conserved in the form of phosphorylated glucose. Furthermore, we demonstrated an in vitro 17-thermophilic enzyme pathway that can convert all glucose units of starch, regardless of branched and linear contents, with water to hydrogen at a theoretic yield (i.e., 12 H2 per glucose), three times of the theoretical yield from dark microbial fermentation. The use of a biomimetic electron transport chain enabled to achieve a maximum volumetric productivity of 90.2mmol of H2/L/h at 20g/L starch. The complete oxidation of starch to hydrogen by this in vitro synthetic (enzymatic) biosystem suggests that starch as a natural solar fuel becomes a high-density hydrogen storage compound with a gravimetric density of more than 14% H2-based mass and an electricity density of more than 3000Wh/kg of starch.",44,,246,252,Fermentation; Solar fuel; Chemistry; Hydrogen production; Phosphorolysis; Water splitting; Chemical engineering; Starch; Biochemistry; Hydrogen storage; Hydrolysis,Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; In vitro metabolic engineering; Starch phosphorylation; Thermophilic enzymes; Water splitting,"Archaeal Proteins/chemistry; Bacterial Proteins/chemistry; Hydrogen/chemistry; Metabolic Engineering/methods; Models, Chemical; Oxidation-Reduction; Recombinant Proteins/chemistry; Starch/chemistry; Water/chemistry",Archaeal Proteins; Bacterial Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; Water; Hydrogen; Starch,"Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fuel Cell Technologies Office; Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28974378/ https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5842365 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28974378 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28974378 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717617301921 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717617301921,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2017.09.015,28974378,10.1016/j.ymben.2017.09.015,2759220219,,0,000-614-016-662-022; 010-080-757-240-272; 010-193-467-490-274; 010-382-598-075-145; 012-723-535-349-415; 017-029-341-564-864; 017-459-207-557-217; 022-523-384-489-512; 023-939-469-852-902; 024-012-026-732-605; 026-708-398-076-803; 028-346-113-906-795; 028-681-710-637-755; 028-928-703-535-322; 029-027-283-163-275; 029-772-515-756-986; 031-422-072-021-535; 031-865-557-192-642; 034-439-999-750-055; 035-619-655-621-895; 046-695-472-711-875; 046-793-035-544-107; 048-976-300-909-395; 049-580-424-649-113; 049-834-758-004-099; 050-296-508-887-642; 051-419-785-679-781; 052-166-398-507-211; 055-168-522-702-056; 057-174-780-045-208; 058-478-333-946-097; 062-503-187-475-35X; 063-264-822-040-939; 066-141-784-647-287; 074-827-986-834-925; 075-875-022-088-529; 076-947-220-857-372; 083-941-035-615-562; 085-378-393-071-625; 085-805-143-720-18X; 088-612-875-468-82X; 090-177-087-406-124; 090-695-693-877-911; 097-654-685-713-574; 102-582-055-250-295; 104-962-886-284-178; 111-001-493-367-491; 111-173-462-586-887; 112-614-751-243-968; 117-751-218-783-002; 141-523-282-059-006; 173-909-370-393-090,28

With the growing capacity of out-spread renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required, such as the production of electrolytic hydrogen by water electrolysis. Consequently, we envision a rapid market penetration of water electrolyzers in the next years. Nevertheless, the deployment of current, commercially available electrolyzer stacks and systems is conceivable for the current initial period of energy transition and shall go over the next decades. However, electrolyzers still need transformation, rupturing from small, costly and low-efficiency units into game-change electrolyzers much larger than 10 MW, with efficiencies above 80%, power densities greater than 10 W/cm2, and demonstrated durability above 100.000 hours. To achieve these goals, fast and large R&amp;D investment is necessary, strong commitment from government and society; all tied with focused and intensive international collaboration. Over the past 10 years, new companies and projects have appeared, with new leaders being consequently established in this growing “niche”. In this presentation I will show our latest R&amp;D approaches; aiming to increase efficiency, improve durability, and reduce the investment/operating costs of electrolyzers to allow large market penetration of these systems. We believe that only through cutting-edge R&amp;D and significant advancements; we will be able to ultimately establish “green” hydrogen as a commodity in the energy storage market, and contribute to our so much desired environmentally friendly hydrogen economy.    </jats:p>",MA2020-01,42,1830,1830,Current (fluid); Nanotechnology; Materials science; Membrane; Polymer; Electrolyte,,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2020-01421830mtgabs,http://dx.doi.org/10.1149/ma2020-01421830mtgabs,,10.1149/ma2020-01421830mtgabs,3024453670,,0,,0

The electricity sector worldwide is undergoing a remarkable change. Since 2012, new additions in renewables overtook additions in fossil and nuclear power generation capacities1. In 2015, global investment in new renewable power capacity, at USD 265.8 bn, was more than double the USD 130 bn allocated to new coal and natural gas fired power plants2. Renewables outpaced fossil fuels regarding capacity additions and investments. Due to the increasing commitment to carbon emission reduction, climate change mitigation is now a worldwide target. The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016 after countries responsible for an estimated 55 % of the total global greenhouse gas emissions (including China, the USA and the European Union) have ratified it. Political measures that reduce emissions (e.g. subsidies and tax reduction for technologies, bans for other technologies, CO2 pricing) will probably increase in the most important markets.

The framework includes process synthesis and design, process simulation, and modeling toward the technical, economic, and environmental performance of the CO2-to-fuels pathway. Based on 72 CO2-to-fuels pathways examined, we discussed the trade-off between economic output (via unit production cost of fuels) and environmental impact (via net CO2 equivalent emissions). In addition, an optimization model was used to identify the optimal pathway and the decision to use conventional (black) or renewable (green) hydrogen in different scenarios. An extended sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the important role of H2 in mitigation of CO2eq and its economic potential, globally and locally, as well as the prospect of future CO2-based fuels. This study provides practical decision-making strategies to major carbon-emitting countries to make decisions on using domestic resources to balance economics and environmental protection in the CCU4E framework. The green hydrogen price is revealed as the key factor in future CCU4E by allowing a huge reduction in CO2eq emission at a more stable and lower price.",15,1,169,184,Environmental economics; Environmental impact assessment; Work (electrical); Environmental analysis; Renewable energy; Process simulation; Energy products; Techno economic; Environmental science; Unit (housing),,,,National Research Foundation of Korea,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2021/EE/D1EE01444G#! http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2021/EE/D1EE01444G,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ee01444g,,10.1039/d1ee01444g,3216780838,,0,001-523-782-120-559; 002-993-585-670-546; 003-769-354-196-496; 003-785-662-918-059; 007-356-019-408-260; 009-125-600-139-396; 009-359-083-131-32X; 011-397-447-935-943; 012-254-640-294-55X; 014-057-155-518-046; 016-387-373-092-64X; 017-802-858-940-581; 019-050-530-675-001; 021-448-768-584-750; 022-845-378-389-103; 024-100-778-213-621; 024-868-570-097-375; 026-779-469-943-555; 028-929-880-790-898; 029-025-161-046-880; 033-166-977-082-300; 034-518-469-859-307; 039-894-782-514-090; 045-351-364-269-914; 049-484-844-534-216; 050-350-666-548-771; 050-354-896-582-404; 051-836-220-930-139; 053-720-389-487-636; 054-036-597-481-277; 056-502-109-676-584; 060-837-261-252-128; 065-178-715-670-347; 068-942-047-000-46X; 069-297-224-773-031; 074-403-105-813-288; 074-638-353-545-848; 075-066-893-667-374; 076-307-539-675-962; 080-283-990-136-139; 083-723-536-912-420; 087-675-973-122-912; 088-132-442-341-927; 090-259-170-870-859; 095-103-015-573-863; 097-485-219-012-75X; 100-864-298-737-105; 102-816-087-946-237; 104-555-133-828-515; 105-749-907-828-247; 112-831-028-418-600; 113-217-582-252-00X; 114-982-822-240-898; 115-365-071-495-699; 117-242-758-684-309; 123-747-029-922-961; 129-116-252-937-709; 132-559-922-637-694; 134-308-853-198-064; 140-519-581-689-616; 142-969-286-236-850; 145-208-886-301-241; 168-087-925-799-721; 173-163-070-422-090; 174-972-701-994-885,2

In this context, green hydrogen produced by offshore wind emerges as a promising solution to remove barriers towards a carbon-free economy in Europe and beyond. Motivated by the recent developments in Denmark with the decision to construct the world's first artificial Offshore Energy Hub, this paper investigates how the lowest cost for green hydrogen can be achieved. A model proposing an integrated design of the hydrogen and offshore electric power infrastructure, determining the levelised costs of both hydrogen and electricity, is proposed. The economic feasibility of hydrogen production from Offshore Wind Power Hubs is evaluated considering the combination of different electrolyser placements, technologies and modes of operations. The results show that costs down to 2.4 EUR per kg can be achieved for green hydrogen production offshore, competitive with the hydrogen costs currently produced by natural gas. Moreover, a reduction of up to 13 pct. of the cost of wind electricity is registered when an electrolyser is installed offshore shaving the peak loads.",1,,100005,,Marine engineering; Hydrogen production; Electricity; Turbine; Context (language use); Environmental science; Electric power; Natural gas; Wind power; Offshore wind power; Environmental economics; Hydrogen production; Electricity; Turbine; Context (language use); Environmental science; Electric power; Natural gas; Wind power; Offshore wind power,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04151 https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04151 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210404151S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rset.2021.100005,,10.1016/j.rset.2021.100005,3195614252; 3197245487,,0,008-480-101-321-265; 017-869-153-118-199; 034-124-699-194-740; 034-570-543-062-303; 039-570-352-683-141; 054-069-006-915-282; 102-322-893-237-929; 113-853-859-195-501; 124-625-251-629-177; 142-190-141-278-102; 151-670-321-993-866; 185-147-704-266-68X; 189-095-687-971-89X; 194-907-161-364-018; 199-285-356-113-313,1

Bangoura,"Abstract This paper presents a prominent e-learning tool that is part of deliverable packages of Hy2Green Project (Ref. 2017-1-ES01-KA203-038302). The aim of the project is to develop an online training course that can help to improve new professional profiles in hydrogen technologies, in line with the energy transition model in Europe. As part of this training course and as result of a team collaboration, a remote laboratory based on hydrogen technology has been designed and implemented. Through the online platform, students from every part of the world can access remotely and in real-time, to a real laboratory built from a scaled green-hydrogen production plant. The green-hydrogen production plant has, in addition to hydrogen production and storage subsystems, a fuel cell, through which electricity is generated with the stored hydrogen. The developed remote laboratory offers technological and educational improvements. From the technological point of view, it allows handling a real installation, throughout the entire energy conversion process, being able to carry out laboratory tests, to characterize the different components. This remote laboratory is proposed as a multidisciplinary tool, where students develop their skills in automatic control, system modelling and renewable energy management. On the other side, from the educational point of view, this proposal contributes to democratization of education. That is nowadays equipment related to hydrogen technology is not cheap, so this implies that not all educational centres cannot afford to have a hydrogen laboratory. The remote laboratory presented in this work offers the possibility to carry out laboratory practices to whatever the student and the university are.",53,2,17556,17563,Manufacturing engineering; Automatic control; Work (electrical); Renewable energy; Deliverable; Remote laboratory; Energy transition; Computer science; Process (engineering); Hydrogen technologies,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405896320334285,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2020.12.2668,,10.1016/j.ifacol.2020.12.2668,3153585726,,0,030-975-389-121-044; 032-836-390-454-818; 037-640-112-681-970; 106-707-833-759-349; 111-181-097-371-318; 163-126-485-912-037,0

Yakovlev,"<jats:p>In the context of the ongoing reformatting of world economic relations, Latin American countries have increased opportunities for technological upsurge and digital modernization of key sectors of national economies. At the same time, Latin American entrepreneurs and politicians seek to act rationally and cautiously. In particular, in the energy sector, the states of the region are trying to combine the transition to carbon neutrality based on the predominant use of new technologies and renewable energy carriers with the intensive exploitation of traditional energy sources, including conventional and shale hydrocarbons. In the mining industry, the main task of Latin American countries is to decarbonize the production process with the help of “green” hydrogen and the most advanced methods of extraction and processing of raw materials. Of global importance are the huge reserves of lithium located in Latin America, without which the further deployment of the technological revolution is extremely difficult. This explains the significant interest shown by transnational corporations in the development of deposits of the “lithium triangle”. In the field of agriculture in Latin America, profound changes are taking place, the system of so-called precision farming is shaping. The role of Latin American countries (primarily Brazil) as suppliers of food to the world market is constantly increasing. All this, and much more, signals new trends in the region that change its usual economic appearance. As shown in the article, the rapid growth of the technology sector in Latin America based on digitalization, “green” energy and precision farming can lead to a deep modernization of the key sectors of the economy and ensure the transition of the region to the “new business normal”, which is the consistent structural transformation and adaptation of Latin American countries to post-Covid world economic realities.</jats:p>",66,3,110,118,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.20542/0131-2227-2022-66-3-110-118,,10.20542/0131-2227-2022-66-3-110-118,,,0,,0

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable electricity to produce green hydrogen with high-purity has been considered to be a promising technology. Unfortunately, the reaction of water electrolysis always requires a large excess potential, let alone the large-scale application (e.g., >500 mA cm−2 needs a cell voltage range of 1.8–2.4 V). Thus, developing cost-effective and robust transition metal electrocatalysts working at high current density is imperative and urgent for industrial electrocatalytic water splitting. In this review, the strategies and requirements for the design of self-supported electrocatalysts are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the fundamental mechanisms of water electrolysis (OER or HER) are analyzed, and the required important evaluation parameters, relevant testing conditions and potential conversion in exploring electrocatalysts working at high current density are also introduced. Specifically, recent progress in the engineering of self-supported transition metal-based electrocatalysts for either HER or OER, as well as overall water splitting (OWS), including oxides, hydroxides, phosphides, sulfides, nitrides and alloys applied in the alkaline electrolyte at large current density condition is highlighted in detail, focusing on current advances in the nanostructure design, controllable fabrication and mechanistic understanding for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. Finally, remaining challenges and outlooks for constructing self-supported transition metal electrocatalysts working at large current density are proposed. It is expected to give guidance and inspiration to rationally design and prepare these electrocatalysts for practical applications, and thus further promote the practical production of hydrogen via electrochemical water splitting.",13,30,12788,12817,Combustion; Renewable energy; Materials science; Current density; Water splitting; Electrolysis of water; Hydrogen; Electrochemistry; Engineering physics; Electrolyte,,,,Shanxi Scholarship Council of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/nr/d1nr02592a#!

Forest based abundant lignocellulosic biomass as a renewable feedstock can be an attractive source of biofuels and biochemicals. This study evaluated the production of hydrogen (H2) along with platform chemicals from an organosol pretreated birch sawdust (SD). Acidogenic fermentation (AF) of pretreated SD resulted in production of green H2 (121.4 mL/gVS) along with short (17.8 g/L) and medium (2.64 g/L) chain carboxylic acids. Further integration of AF with anaerobic digestion (AD) in a biorefinery framework offered production of biomethane (bioCH4: 246 mL/gVS) from the leftover SD from AF. Integration of bioH2 with bioCH4 at different time interval of digestion showed 8–14 L biohythane formation ran with a H2 fraction of 1.6–0.3 H2/(H2 + CH4) documenting energy content of 8–9.08 kJ/gVS.,344,Pt A,126164,126164,Chemistry; Raw material; Lignocellulosic biomass; Biorefinery; Sawdust; Organosolv; Anaerobic digestion; Pulp and paper industry; Biofuel; Biogas,Biohydrogen; Biorefinery; Organosolv; Sawdust; Volatile fatty acids,Betula; Biofuels; Biomass; Fermentation; Hydrogen/analysis,Biofuels; Hydrogen,Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas; Vetenskapsrådet; Kempestiftelserna,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34699962 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852421015066,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.126164,34699962,10.1016/j.biortech.2021.126164,3209562423,,0,003-403-125-223-685; 004-014-411-009-96X; 009-761-584-084-096; 011-679-531-303-194; 012-951-330-175-591; 013-291-223-931-430; 014-141-423-061-479; 016-384-186-168-254; 017-275-591-089-238; 021-047-236-415-019; 021-355-834-631-357; 023-092-854-556-631; 023-848-073-303-428; 024-574-026-027-37X; 026-088-935-930-936; 029-844-461-025-407; 031-980-751-607-729; 032-748-928-273-809; 036-168-690-647-51X; 037-729-843-498-863; 038-289-700-427-443; 038-430-269-398-066; 044-165-459-344-811; 046-222-467-764-497; 046-407-448-306-571; 046-767-122-906-250; 047-241-298-715-968; 047-514-175-026-290; 049-503-506-901-707; 052-346-500-416-251; 053-959-285-737-404; 055-926-150-031-115; 058-068-641-512-459; 059-929-155-493-238; 062-371-231-255-53X; 068-366-229-486-461; 070-134-953-898-642; 072-787-080-665-399; 073-213-399-098-190; 075-060-220-074-980; 084-495-211-999-489; 087-903-933-700-775; 089-480-804-810-08X; 095-514-917-240-415; 106-624-195-099-169; 123-411-113-439-076; 124-370-462-491-049; 132-817-600-043-745; 136-727-086-279-611; 161-452-197-918-240,0

In order to draw attention to the problem of hydrogen energy in Russia and the Republic of Tatarstan, the article analyzes the development paths and main opportunities for the production, transportation, and use of hydrogen at the enterprises of Tatarstan, and calculates the economic efficiency of the “green” hydrogen production by electrolysis at TPPs with CCGTs in Tatarstan. METHODS. Research methods are based on the analysis of literature data and mathematical calculations. RESULTS. Tatarstan, as one of the leading economically developed regions of Russia, could take part in the “green” hydrogen production, the electrochemical equipment design for its production, the development of technologies for the fuel cells use, research and training of highly qualified specialists in the field of hydrogen energy. According to the calculations, the production of the most environmentally friendly hydrogen at TPPs with CCGT in Tatarstan will currently cost an average of 2 euros per kilogram, which is significantly lower than the existing market value. CONCLUSION. Tatarstan can become a competitive region for the “green” hydrogen production and distribution. The main areas of activity should be the pure hydrogen production, the industrial production of freight transport on fuel cells, the production of megawatt-class electrolysers, the utilization of hydrogen-containing petroleum gases at TPPs in gas turbines or in combined cycle power plants with fuel cells.",288,,01074,,Economic efficiency; Combined cycle; Environmentally friendly; Hydrogen production; Production (economics); Environmental science; Hydrogen; Waste management; Industrial production; Hydrogen fuel,,,,,https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/abs/2021/64/e3sconf_suse2021_01074/e3sconf_suse2021_01074.html https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2021/64/e3sconf_suse2021_01074.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202128801074,,10.1051/e3sconf/202128801074,3179351133,,0,007-383-662-887-815; 021-253-767-394-269; 022-574-314-228-130; 022-789-141-874-887; 042-862-909-583-811; 088-563-694-937-406; 094-057-717-062-864; 107-920-287-282-641; 110-207-608-447-73X; 141-073-862-105-771,0

We consider a vertically related market with hydrogen producers upstream and fuel stations downstream. Production technologies differ in cost efficiency and carbon emissions. We show that when consumers have limited information about the hydrogen origin, no new green producers are able to enter the market. A label for green hydrogen allows multiple production technologies to co-exist, but society is better off when producers use vertical restraints to increase consumers' information.",,,,,Cost efficiency; Upstream (petroleum industry); Business; Downstream (petroleum industry); Production (economics); Vertical restraints; Industrial organization; Certification; Greenhouse gas; Hydrogen,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/wpaper/hal-03371277.html https://hal-univ-pau.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03371277/document,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/wpaper/hal-03371277.html,,,3204975308,,0,,0

De Vero; XIn Wang; Subhasish Mukerjee; Mark Selby,"Ceres Power continues to acquire commercial partners for its low-temperature metal supported SteelCell® SOC technology based predominantly around the use of ceria. This unique design architecture allows for a robust, low cost, subsidy free fuel cell product, whilst retaining the advantages of fuel flexibility, high efficiency and low degradation.Over the last year, significant commercial developments have taken place, rapidly progressing genuine mass-market adoption of SteelCell® technology for power generation. Two major OEM partners, Robert Bosch GmbH in Germany and Doosan Fuel Cell in South Korea now have licenses to manufacture SteelCell® cells and stacks with a full technology transfer from Ceres, with a commitment to volume manufacturing. Doosan is initially building a 50MW/y manufacturing plant with potential to extend that further in future. This complements Ceres' own manufacturing facility in Redhill, UK which is fully operational with an expandable capacity of 2MW/y to meet demand from other customer demonstration programs.Other active customer programs include the successful ongoing commercial launch of a 4.2kWe CHP system by Miura in Japan and the development of a 30kWe range extender for electric buses by Weichai Power in China.Another significant commercial development is Ceres Power agreeing a strategic partnership with AVL in Austria to combine engineering expertise and knowhow in fuel cell system development and conduct joint R&D, which will enable the incorporation of SteelCell® technology into new applications. The first agreement has already been signed with an unnamed customer.As part of a drive to broaden the applicability of SteelCell® technology and play a larger part in the rapidly developing green hydrogen economy, a major program has been initiated to evaluate and develop SteelCell® technology for steam electrolysis and the potential production of E-fuels.All of these developments are rapidly bringing about the full commercialization of SOC technology as a significant contributor to the evolving net zero energy sector.",103,1,679,684,Manufacturing engineering; Engineering; Zero-energy building; Flexibility (engineering); Commercialization; Hydrogen economy; Electricity generation; Product (business); Original equipment manufacturer; Subsidy,,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/10301.0679ecst,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/10301.0679ecst,,,3177555568,,0,,0
002-977-877-925-010,New developments in the local analysis of non-covalent interactions,2019-12-10,2019,,,,,,Julia Contreras-García; Francesca Peccati; Rubén Laplaza,"Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory [1] is routinely used to assess hydrogen bond formation, however its stringent criteria controversially exclude some systems that otherwise appear to exhibit weak hydrogen bonds. NCI [2,3] is a new tool based on the density and its derivatives that provides a rapid and rich representation of van der Waals interactions (green), hydrogen bonds (blue), and steric clashes (red) as low-gradient-low-density isosurfaces. More generally, a view of non-bonded interactions emerges as continuous surfaces rather than close contacts between atom pairs, providing insight into the multiple small contribution to macromolecular interaction. This regional approach to interactions overcomes the known caveats of analyzing electron density critical points in AIM, which are too restrictive because of their locality. Firstly, we show that NCI is able to provide a chemically intuitive description of hydrogen bonding for a series of 1,n-alkanediols that experimentally demonstrate hydrogen bonds of varying strength, where AIM fails. [4] Since understanding non-covalent interactions requires an inherent quantification for their comparison, we have introduced the definition of NCI volumes The connexion between integrals and energetics is reviewed for benchmark systems, showing that this simple approach can lead to GGA-quality energies while scaling with the number of atoms involved in the interaction (not the total number of atoms). Given the inherent interest of these local approaches to big systems, we have also incorporated an adaptive grid which allows the quantification of NCI properties in big systems where wavefunctions are not available in a fast, parallelizable and efficient manner. This type of implementation can for example be used to analyse the evolution of classical MD trajectories. We show that the approach is able to reveal non-equilibrated runs and highlight the main interactions in equilibrated ones. In order to render it more accessible, this latest version of the code (released on 19th of june 2019! [5]) has been implemented in the free web server NCIweb [6], which allows the fully automatized analysis of non-covalent interactions of large PDB files in a matter of minutes, providing a powerful resource to the biochemistry community. 1.

The sunbelt of the Earth has a great potential for large-scale hydrogen production. One promising pathway to solar hydrogen is to use economically priced electricity from photovoltaics (PV) for electrochemical water splitting. However, storing electricity with batteries is still expensive and without storage only a small operating capacity of electrolyser systems can be reached. Combining PV with concentrated solar power (CSP) and thermal energy storage (TES) seems a good pathway to reach more electrolyser full load hours and thereby lower levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOH). This work introduces an energy system model for finding cost-optimal designs of such PV/CSP hybrid hydrogen production plants based on a global optimization algorithm. The model includes an operational strategy which improves the interplay between PV and CSP part, allowing also to store PV surplus electricity as heat. An exemplary study for stand-alone hydrogen production with an alkaline electrolyser (AEL) system is carried out. Three different locations with different solar resources are considered, regarding the total installed costs (TIC) to obtain realistic LCOH values. The study shows that a combination of PV and CSP is an auspicious concept for large-scale solar hydrogen production, leading to lower costs than using one of the technologies on its own. For today’s PV and CSP costs, minimum levelized costs of hydrogen of 4.04 USD/kg were determined for a plant located in Ouarzazate (Morocco). Considering the foreseen decrease in PV and CSP costs until 2030, cuts the LCOH to 3.09 USD/kg while still a combination of PV and CSP is the most economic system.",14,12,3437,,Thermal energy storage; Hydrogen production; Electricity; Process engineering; Production (economics); Concentrated solar power; Water splitting; Environmental science; Photovoltaics; Hybrid power,,,,Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/12/3437 https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/12/3437/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14123437,,10.3390/en14123437,3168227535,,0,005-943-388-866-703; 010-597-633-547-549; 011-747-418-350-476; 019-647-153-763-04X; 021-985-575-104-38X; 034-095-649-400-139; 095-998-800-676-120; 102-957-555-906-682; 108-039-416-556-411; 130-612-870-958-409; 132-153-421-158-652; 155-774-307-661-015,1

While current technologies are sufficient to support commercial deployment of fresh water electrolyzers, there remain a few well-defined challenges in the path of commercializing direct seawater electrolyzers, predominantly related to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and the competing chlorine evolution reaction (CER) at the anode. Herein, we report the facile and swift fabrication of an S,B-codoped CoFe oxyhydroxide via solution combustion synthesis for the OER with apparent CER suppression abilities. The as-prepared S,B-(CoFe)OOH-H attained ultralow overpotentials of 161 and 278 mV for achieving current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, in an alkaline saline (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl) electrolyte, with a low Tafel slope of 46.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. Chronoamperometry testing of the codoped bimetallic oxyhydroxides showed very stable behavior in harsh alkaline saline and in neutral pH saline environments. S,B-(CoFe)OOH-H oxyhydroxide showed a notable decrease in CER production in comparison to the other S,B-codoped counterparts. Selectivity measurements through online FE calculations showed high OER selectivity in alkaline (FE ∼ 97%) and neutral (FE ∼ 91%) pH saline conditions under standard 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> operation.

Lynch; John Curtis,"Abstract With a relatively high energy density, hydrogen is attracting increasing attention in research, commercial and political spheres, specifically as a fuel for residential heating, which is proving to be a difficult sector to decarbonise in some circumstances. Hydrogen production is dependent on the power system so any scale use of hydrogen for residential heating will impact various aspects of the power system, including electricity prices and renewable generation curtailment (i.e. wind, solar). Using a linearised optimal power flow model and the power infrastructure on the island of Ireland this paper examines least cost optimal investment in electrolysers in the presence of Ireland's 70% renewable electricity target by 2030. The introduction of electrolysers in the power system leads to an increase in emissions from power generation, which is inconsistent with some definitions of green hydrogen. Electricity prices are marginally higher with electrolysers whereas the optimal location of electrolysers is driven by a combination of residential heating demand and potential surplus power supplies at electricity nodes.",46,53,26725,26740,Environmental economics; Power (physics); Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Electricity; Investment (macroeconomics); Environmental science; Electricity generation; Hydrogen; Electric power system,,,,,https://www.esri.ie/publications/green-hydrogen-for-heating-and-its-impact-on-the-power-system https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319921020231,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.171,,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.171,3175852843,,0,001-064-846-886-538; 002-156-768-799-467; 002-777-414-881-297; 002-787-672-385-201; 002-981-063-113-218; 007-744-012-180-309; 012-114-997-069-14X; 014-598-946-857-425; 015-400-409-608-175; 019-258-636-597-585; 019-432-128-562-993; 022-129-497-976-004; 023-795-138-721-449; 029-145-726-203-756; 031-931-772-745-222; 038-840-012-936-756; 039-288-463-003-242; 041-001-634-230-839; 045-515-948-448-535; 047-439-572-750-04X; 056-923-286-878-334; 065-435-414-238-061; 068-917-444-978-758; 069-164-044-089-217; 077-855-968-510-254; 080-645-552-035-106; 081-704-117-203-500; 082-458-993-960-62X; 084-873-500-084-520; 087-214-940-751-323; 087-734-032-056-068; 092-385-516-042-939; 093-235-826-721-34X; 106-130-137-082-414; 106-761-811-298-075; 117-567-579-633-536; 124-830-045-385-952; 126-478-206-029-290; 126-500-342-417-86X; 128-393-146-440-298; 134-333-619-689-089; 140-663-276-871-055; 141-705-959-692-127; 146-916-888-297-542; 153-128-090-714-227; 157-802-027-562-344,5

The production of bio-hydrogen from biomass is of interest for several reasons: it delivers green hydrogen from a renewable source for storage, hydrogen for mixing with natural or biogas, and hydrogen for synthesis processes. Today, hydrogen can be realised with efficient electrolysis processes, in which case the cost of power significantly contributes to the cost of hydrogen per kg. The real advantage of bio-hydrogen is the decentralised provision compared to the production based on natural gas as discussed in literature.

It may contribute to integrating variable renewable energy sources if production is sufficiently flexible in time. Using an open-source co-optimization model of the power sector and four options for supplying hydrogen at German filling stations, we find a trade-off between energy efficiency and temporal flexibility. For lower shares of renewables and hydrogen, more energy-efficient and less flexible small-scale on-site electrolysis is optimal. For higher shares of renewables and/or hydrogen, more flexible but less energy-efficient large-scale hydrogen supply chains gain importance, as they allow to temporally disentangle hydrogen production from demand via storage. Liquid hydrogen emerges as particularly beneficial, followed by liquid organic hydrogen carriers and gaseous hydrogen. Large-scale hydrogen supply chains can deliver substantial power sector benefits, mainly through reduced renewable curtailment. Energy modelers and system planners should consider the distinct flexibility characteristics of hydrogen supply chains in more detail when assessing the role of green hydrogen in future energy transition scenarios.

Stoerzinger; Robert Matthew Asmussen,"<jats:p>Electrocatalytic water splitting is a possible route to the expanded generation of green hydrogen; however, a long-term challenge is the requirement of fresh water as an electrolyzer feed. The use of seawater as a direct feed for electrolytic hydrogen production would alleviate fresh water needs and potentially open an avenue for locally generated hydrogen from marine hydrokinetic or off-shore power sources. One environmental limitation to seawater electrolysis is the generation of chlorine as a competitive anodic reaction. This work evaluates transition metal (W, Co, Fe, Sn, and Ru) doping of Mn-Mo-based catalysts as a strategy to suppress chlorine evolution while sustaining catalytic efficiency. Electrochemical evaluations in neutral chloride solution and raw seawater showed the promise of a novel Mn-Mo-Ru electrode system for oxygen evolution efficiency and enhanced catalytic activity. Subsequent stability testing in a flowing raw seawater flume highlighted the need for improved catalyst stability for long-term applications of Mn-Mo-Ru catalysts. This work highlights that elements known to be selective toward chlorine evolution in simple oxide form (e.g., RuO2) may display different trends in selectivity when used as isolated dopants, where Ru suppressed chlorine evolution in Mn-based catalysts.</jats:p>",11,24,11911,,,,,,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Water Power Technologies Office,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app112411911,,10.3390/app112411911,,,0,001-433-982-330-519; 003-830-584-951-514; 004-297-613-658-573; 007-450-180-776-853; 009-453-907-714-642; 011-924-681-851-387; 012-337-551-169-195; 014-180-958-606-641; 018-811-655-389-399; 021-166-173-667-535; 023-487-485-570-046; 025-253-003-658-637; 026-088-614-578-10X; 026-384-381-935-933; 028-066-999-848-603; 033-429-585-805-84X; 036-087-094-176-411; 039-738-909-971-818; 039-985-093-366-604; 041-599-187-308-452; 046-166-722-357-386; 048-035-817-587-005; 049-160-797-777-854; 051-312-924-407-584; 053-136-822-716-178; 053-861-551-748-46X; 055-873-388-742-148; 056-028-073-244-740; 057-420-774-271-242; 058-712-217-327-857; 071-130-591-488-440; 074-404-548-039-062; 076-437-249-230-522; 077-368-823-807-26X; 085-003-119-410-654; 088-190-084-039-909; 095-264-027-355-326; 125-551-793-577-989; 144-051-504-941-886; 177-696-708-451-999; 185-152-857-260-859,0

P. Hansora; Pankaj Sharma; Ji-Wook Jang; Jae Sung Lee,"Solar water splitting is a promising approach to transform sunlight into renewable, sustainable and green hydrogen energy. There are three representative ways of transforming solar radiation into molecular hydrogen, which are the photocatalytic (PC), photoelectrochemical (PEC), and photovoltaic–electrolysis (PV–EC) routes. Having the future perspective of green hydrogen economy in mind, this review article discusses devices and systems for solar-to-hydrogen production including comparison of the above solar water splitting systems. The focus is placed on a critical assessment of the key components needed to scale up PEC water splitting systems such as materials efficiency, cost, elemental abundancy, stability, fuel separation, device operability, cell architecture, and techno-economic aspects of the systems. The review follows a stepwise approach and provides (i) a summary of the basic principles and photocatalytic materials employed for PEC water splitting, (ii) an extensive discussion of technologies, procedures, and system designs, and (iii) an introduction to international demonstration projects, and the development of benchmarked devices and large-scale prototype systems. The task of scaling up of laboratory overall water splitting devices to practical systems may be called “an artificial photosynthetic leaf-to-farm challenge”.",48,7,1908,1971,Operability; Photosynthesis;

003-977-172-351-842,Application of Green Hydrogen in Mobility Sector,2021-05-25,2021,,,,,,Lorenzo Reyes-Bozo; Carlos Fúnez-Guerra; Claudia Sandoval Yanez; Guillermo Schaffeld,"At a global level, different studies disclose that transport systems are responsible for 25% of CO2 emissions. In the context of sustainable mobility, one of the challenges in the short term is associated with the research and improvement of alternative fuels, which should allow a fast decrease in the generation of greenhouse gases due to sustainable transport means. In this sense, green hydrogen can play a fundamental role. Green hydrogen is the basis for producing synthetic fuels, which can replace oil and its derivatives. Synthetic fuels or e-fuel are hydrocarbons produced from carbon dioxide (CO2) and green hydrogen (H2) as the only raw materials. H2 or efuel could be used in many sectors (manufacturing, residential, transportation, mining and other industries). In this study, different applications of hydrogen are evaluated by techno-economic analysis. The main variable that affects the production of hydrogen and its derivatives is the cost of electricity. Considering the renewable energy potential of Chile, it is feasible to develop in Chile the green hydrogen production as an energy vector, which would be technically and economically viable, together with the environmental benefits",,002,183,186,Sustainable transport; Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Synthetic fuel; Raw material; Context (language use); Environmental science; Greenhouse gas; Waste management; Cost of electricity by source,,,,,https://monami.hs-mittweida.de/files/12334/Lorenzo.Reyes-Bozo.paperv3.pdf https://monami.hs-mittweida.de/frontdoor/index/index/year/2021/docId/12334,https://monami.hs-mittweida.de/frontdoor/index/index/year/2021/docId/12334,,,3165691858,,0,,0

The H2 and CO2 permeability of PIM-1 is about 1300–4000 Barrer and 3000–8000 Barrer, respectively. However, it has a relatively low H2/CO2 selectivity of 0.4–0.8. Different from the previous UV rearrangement approach, for the first time we report here a viable method to tune the intrinsic properties of PIM-1 blend membranes from being CO2-selective to H2-selective via blending with Matrimid and subsequent cross-linking the mixed matrix membrane with diamines at room temperature. The ideal H2/CO2 selectivity of the membrane after modification by 2 h triethylenetetramine (TETA) improved dramatically from 0.4–0.8 to 9.6, with a H2 permeability of 395 Barrer. The modified membranes also show exceptional separation performance, surpassing the present upper bound for H2/CO2, H2/N2, H2/CH4 and O2/N2 separations. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed that the diamine cross-linking successfully alters the membrane morphology from a dense to a composite structure. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and sorption data confirmed that the modified membrane has a smaller d-spacing and a decrease in the diffusivity coefficient. Our results also affirmed that the spatial structure, rather than the pKa value, of the diamine is the prevailing factor which governs the reactivity of diamines towards the PIM-1/Matrimid membrane due to the low concentration of cross-linkable polyimides distributing randomly in the polymer matrix.

Developing efficient yet economic electrocatalysts is crucial to decrease the cost of electricity and electrolytic cell. Meanwhile, electrolysis in seawater electrolyte can further reduce feedstock cost. Here we synthesize a type of electrocatalyst where trace precious metals are strongly anchored on corrosion-resistive matrix. As an example, the produced Pt/Ni-Mo electrocatalyst only needs an overpotential of 113 mV to reach an ultrahigh current density of 2000 mA cm-2 in saline-alkaline electrolyte, standing as the best performance so far. It shows high activity and long durability in various electrolytes and under harsh conditions, including strong alkaline and simulated seawater electrolytes, and under elevated temperatures up to 80 degree Celsius).

Sanchis; Luis Marroyo,"Renewable energy sources and Electrolysis generate the so-called green Hydrogen, a zeroemission and potentially fossil fuel independent energy source. However, the inherent variability of the renewable energy sources implies a mode of operation for which most current electrolysers have not been designed. This paper analyses the operation of a water electrolyser fed with photovoltaic (PV) generator electric profile. The system, Integrated by a 1 Nm/h Hydrogenics alkaline electrolyser and a 5100 W PV generator with 60 BP585 modules, is installed at the Public University of Navarra (Spain). The PV generator profile fed to the electrolyser is emulated by a custom-made apparatus designed and built by the authors of this paper. The profile is designed according to real irradiance data measured by a calibration cell. The irradiance data are converted to the electric power profile that the PV generator would have delivered in case of having been connected to the electrolyser by means of a DC/DC converter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Finally, from previously measured power-current electrolyser characteristic curves, the current profile to be delivered to the electrolyser is obtained and programmed to the electronic device. The electrolyser was tested for two types of days. During the first day, the irradiance was very stable, whereas during the second day, the irradiance was very variable. The experimental results show an average power consumption rate and an efficiency of 4908 Wh/Nm and 72.1%, on the first day, and 4842 Wh/Nm and 73.3% on the second day. The electrolyser performance was particularly good in spite of the high variability of the electric supply of the second day.",,,,,Automotive engineering; Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Generator (circuit theory); Energy source; Maximum power point tracking; Environmental science; Electric power; Photovoltaic system; Irradiance,,,,,https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/135456 https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/135456/files/HP3c_pp_Urs_Ursua.pdf,https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/135456,,,2275171320,,0,002-665-408-570-533; 011-243-407-852-412; 018-558-463-780-258; 044-271-962-295-593; 048-367-836-704-95X; 097-004-785-322-808; 126-706-963-875-234,3

Compressed hydrogen is being considered as a potential fuel for heavy-duty applications because it will substantially reduce toxic greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutant emissions. The cost of hydrogen will be the main element in the acceptance of compressed hydrogen internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the marketplace because of its effect on the levelized cost of driving. This paper investigates the feasibility of developing a nationwide network of hydrogen refueling infrastructure with the aim to assist in a conversion of long-haul, heavy-duty (LHHD) truck fleet from diesel fuel to hydrogen. This initiative is taken in order to reduce vehicle emissions and support commitments to the climate plans reinforcing active transportation infrastructure together with new transit infrastructure and zero-emission vehicles. Two methods based on constant and variable traffics, using data about hydrogen infrastructure and ICE vehicles, were created to estimate fueling conditions for LHHD truck fleet. Furthermore, a thorough economic study was carried out on several test cases to evaluate how diverse variables affect the final selling price of hydrogen. This gave an understanding of what elements go into the pricing of hydrogen and if it can compete with diesel in the trucking market. Results revealed that the cost to purchase green hydrogen is the utmost part in the pump price of hydrogen. Due to the variety in hydrogen production, there is no defined cost, which renders estimates difficult. Moreover, it was found that the pump price of green hydrogen is on average 239% more expensive than diesel fuel. The methodology proposed and models created in this feasibility study may serve as a valuable tool for future techno-economics of hydrogen refueling stations for other types of ICE fleets or fuel cell vehicles.</jats:p>",144,7,1,48,Heavy duty; Environmental science; Hydrogen; Truck; Waste management,,,,,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/energyresources/article-pdf/doi/10.1115/1.4052921/6782572/jert-21-1676.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4052921,,10.1115/1.4052921,3213392582,,0,002-559-450-059-043; 011-773-650-765-747; 018-086-393-418-92X; 018-790-427-273-976; 018-963-549-606-92X; 019-797-802-543-121; 023-558-160-757-975; 029-624-529-715-873; 039-799-078-553-912; 040-905-750-438-544; 042-200-077-295-522; 051-324-732-615-82X; 053-991-924-425-280; 059-160-812-381-990; 060-082-097-941-067; 064-874-253-079-917; 067-972-473-047-026; 079-051-459-457-685; 086-724-411-271-053; 090-447-970-620-67X; 092-573-757-337-381; 097-975-981-224-203; 102-143-114-577-42X; 131-947-815-943-344; 157-272-871-562-221; 167-839-560-068-135; 171-387-182-580-341,0

A fundamental challenge with this approach is low utilization rates of various parts of the integrated electricity-hydrogen system. To assess the importance of capacity utilization, this paper introduces a novel stylized numerical energy system model incorporating the major elements of electricity and hydrogen generation, transmission and storage, including both ""green"" hydrogen from electrolysis and ""blue"" hydrogen from natural gas reforming with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Balancing renewables with electrolysis results in low utilization of electrolyzers, hydrogen pipelines and storage infrastructure, or electricity transmission networks, depending on whether electrolyzers are co-located with wind farms or demand centers. Blue hydrogen scenarios face similar constraints. High renewable shares impose low utilization rates of CO2 capture, transport and storage infrastructure for conventional CCS, and of hydrogen transmission and storage infrastructure for a novel process (gas switching reforming) that enables flexible power and hydrogen production. In conclusion, both green and blue hydrogen can facilitate the integration of wind and solar energy, but the cost related to low capacity utilization erodes much of the expected economic benefit.",,,,,Capacity utilization; Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Electricity; Process engineering; Variable renewable energy; Hydrogen economy; Environmental science; Solar energy; Natural gas,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/esprep/222474.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/esprep/222474.html,,,3123100991,,0,,0

Therefore, the hope hangs upon it in achieving the zero fuel emissions strategy, which adopted by the largest countries in the world. Also, it is believed that by 2050, hydrogen consumption will represent 24 % of the global energy sector, with investments estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars, compared to only 139 billion dollars at present. There are three types of hydrogen (gray, blue and green) classified based on their production methods and carbon content. Gray hydrogen is usually produced by burning natural gas at high temperatures and once the carbon is removed or captured, the gray hydrogen turns into blue hydrogen. As for green hydrogen with zero emissions, it is produced through the electrolysis of water or by using renewable energy sources such as solar cell, wind energy, etc. to avoid any emissions during the production stages. Despite the efficiency of green hydrogen compared to other types, its price remains a major obstacle in the promotion and marketing, which is estimated at 3.5 Euro/kg, compared to 1.5 Euro/kg for blue hydrogen. In addition to some other obstacles related to infrastructure and raw materials used in the production stages. Recently, and in order to remove all these obstacles, the leading countries in the energy sector pumped more investments to study all these obstacles and assess the current hydrogen market, which in turn leads to the acceleration of the upscaling of hydrogen production. In this context, this research was developed to study all these current and future challenges. In addition to discussing the traditional and modern methods of its production.

In such a supply chain hydrogen; is produced by means of electrolysis, using electricity intermittently produced at offshore wind parks constructed on the Dutch North Sea. We consider settings where the electrolysers are alternatively placed on- or offshore. We formulate deterministic and stochastic (two-stage recourse) mixed-integer linear programming models for these settings. Both modelling approaches result in similar costs and production shortfalls, suggesting there is little benefit to explicitly modelling wind uncertainty. Rather than solving difficult stochastic models, robust solutions can also be obtained from the deterministic model by constructing overcapacity in electricity generation. An overcapacity of just 10% sustains a service level of 80%, and an overcapacity of 25% a 98–99% service level. These overcapacities result in additional costs of less than 8%; and 20%, respectively. We find that both onshore and offshore electrolysers result in similar hydrogen cost prices of around 4–4.5 AC/kg. Because of ease of access and maintenance, ease of future expansion, and the benefits of centralisation, onshore electrolysers should be preferred. The cost price of green hydrogen appears particularly sensitive to wind capacity factors, electrolyser efficiencies, and electrolyser and wind construction costs.; Numerical experiments suggest that modest improvements in each of these parameters could make green hydrogen cost-competitive with fossil-based hydrogen.",,,,,Supply chain; Stochastic modelling; Environmental economics; Service level; Mains electricity; Electricity; Environmental science; Electricity generation; Cost price; Offshore wind power,,,,,https://feb.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/27395/,https://feb.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/27395/,,,3134091861,,0,006-239-227-268-304; 008-676-419-994-210; 019-472-539-187-194; 023-679-603-717-421; 025-368-102-456-213; 026-397-034-209-315; 033-319-808-308-588; 034-124-699-194-740; 042-436-890-645-661; 044-537-461-470-336; 048-237-393-225-101; 051-819-161-597-780; 057-889-144-846-919; 058-955-029-501-869; 060-831-707-223-288; 065-331-516-080-908; 068-047-646-436-563; 075-387-179-882-250; 076-578-930-165-177; 083-576-079-882-512; 089-378-999-967-245; 090-337-726-421-217; 094-676-427-746-611; 096-763-136-385-295; 098-961-326-552-947; 107-316-195-330-529; 110-098-755-233-379; 113-183-225-744-10X; 114-312-581-804-716; 124-830-045-385-952; 125-296-075-774-771; 125-940-156-009-240; 134-634-756-288-205; 151-670-321-993-866; 193-595-455-714-267; 197-871-004-708-232,0

Schmidt; Lorenz Gubler,"<jats:p>The cost of polymer electrolyte water electrolysis (PEWE) is dominated by the price of electricity used to power the water splitting reaction. We present a liquid water fed polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer cell operated at a cell temperature of 100 °C in comparison to a cell operated at state-of-the-art operation temperature of 60 °C over a 300<jats:bold> </jats:bold>h constant current period. The hydrogen conversion efficiency increases by up to 5% at elevated temperature and makes green hydrogen cheaper. However, temperature is a stress factor that accelerates degradation causes in the cell. The PEWE cell operated at a cell temperature of 100 °C shows a 5 times increased cell voltage loss rate compared to the PEWE cell at 60 °C. The initial performance gain was found to be consumed after a projected operation time of 3,500<jats:bold> </jats:bold>h. Elevated temperature operation is only viable if a voltage loss rate of less than 5.8 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>V h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> can be attained. The major degradation phenomena that impact performance loss at 100 °C are ohmic (49%) and anode kinetic losses (45%). Damage to components was identified by post-test electron-microscopic analysis of the catalyst coated membrane and measurement of cation content in the drag water.

To get more insights into conditioning, a PEMEC with Ir-coated gas diffusion electrode (IrGDE) was investigated by electrochemistry and <i>in situ</i> visualization characterization techniques. The changes of polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), and bubble dynamics before and after conditioning are analyzed. The polarization curves show that the cell efficiency increased by 9.15% at 0.4 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the EIS and Tafel slope results indicate that both the ohmic and activation overpotential losses decrease after conditioning. The visualization of bubble formation unveils that the number of bubble sites increased greatly from 14 to 29 per pore after conditioning, at the same voltage of 1.6 V. Under the same current density of 0.2 A/cm<sup>2</sup>; the average bubble detachment size decreased obviously from 35 to 25 μm. The electrochemistry and visualization characterization results jointly unveiled the increase of reaction sites and the surface oxidation on the IrGDE during conditioning, which provides more insights into the conditioning and benefits for the future GDE design and optimization.",14,7,9002,9012,,bubble dynamics; conditioning; electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS); green hydrogen; proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cells (PEMECs); visualization,,,Fuel Cell Technologies Office; Fuel Cell Technologies Office,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c21849,35142208,10.1021/acsami.1c21849,,,0,001-315-702-562-415; 001-914-471-441-230; 005-395-375-279-994; 010-000-586-152-151; 010-318-654-540-00X; 010-818-211-482-833; 014-324-168-720-378; 014-693-807-141-190; 015-011-182-350-675; 015-733-085-746-082; 018-185-177-507-999; 018-865-767-616-764; 020-796-995-461-739; 021-925-716-891-248; 023-242-154-892-432; 023-837-703-423-990; 024-083-545-206-955; 025-325-599-492-745; 029-102-310-544-709; 029-422-238-242-871; 031-172-304-013-464; 031-508-769-848-687; 033-081-196-547-029; 034-360-605-597-958; 035-566-930-643-313; 035-946-423-108-070; 037-462-209-740-077; 038-836-199-903-644; 039-029-327-155-835; 039-216-996-313-160; 041-546-041-817-220; 041-732-206-037-169; 041-841-742-921-92X; 046-833-481-737-949; 049-392-275-810-058; 049-954-238-767-582; 050-689-081-677-036; 050-865-552-709-509; 051-658-466-844-186; 053-158-899-015-561; 053-653-796-420-407; 056-887-487-943-635; 058-771-196-946-076; 061-122-503-697-005; 061-588-458-707-810; 062-840-709-475-427; 063-560-020-949-506; 071-365-669-458-396; 071-814-895-668-405; 072-249-736-977-144; 072-855-938-521-583; 073-284-122-334-988; 081-855-795-209-379; 084-691-157-087-179; 086-054-851-930-34X; 091-535-835-994-958; 093-993-845-894-329; 095-327-166-798-747; 103-864-230-725-932; 105-128-474-651-826; 114-380-246-484-81X; 114-842-825-548-105; 118-466-889-742-213; 126-542-821-901-398; 132-155-659-163-864; 133-700-486-218-392; 136-283-688-196-19X; 140-277-873-453-569; 140-504-316-753-224; 146-169-439-312-026; 175-421-517-204-762; 183-191-873-808-721,0

Traditionally, it was often considered that only transition metal complexes/systems are able to activate hydrogen and to catalyze hydrogenations. This view has been changed recently; more and more metal-free molecules/systems have been found capable of activating hydrogen. Among these developments, the frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) are of particular significance, not only because they exhibit high reactivity toward hydrogen as well as other small molecules, but also because some of them can perform direct catalytic hydrogenations, which pave the way to the development of cheaper and greener hydrogenation catalysts. Inspired by the FLP principle, we used quantum mechanics computations to design molecules for H2, CH4, and NH3 activation and catalysts for hydrogenation of imines, ketones, and alkenes. While our designed molecules are awaiting experimental preparation, the active sites in our designed molecules anticipated the features appeared in the compounds synthesized later by experimentalists. This chapter reviews our computational explorations to enrich FLP chemistry.",332,,231,266,Transition metal; Reactivity (chemistry); Small molecule; Catalysis; Organic chemistry; Chemistry; Combinatorial chemistry; Molecule; Frustrated Lewis pair; Hydrogen; Hydroamination,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/128_2012_385 https://link.springer.com/10.1007%2F128_2012_385 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23114498 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/128_2012_385,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/128_2012_385,23114498,10.1007/128_2012_385,80543310,,0,000-001-207-774-092; 000-022-643-540-762; 000-142-946-314-267; 001-200-907-066-36X; 001-699-565-984-990; 002-408-974-723-226; 002-550-519-666-87X; 002-560-310-496-944; 002-578-945-390-559; 002-789-968-977-686; 003-712-221-337-403; 004-037-752-539-717; 004-394-403-210-716; 005-069-094-933-298; 005-256-390-960-112; 005-383-948-776-499; 006-841-489-831-162; 007-119-560-131-096; 007-268-508-779-011; 007-323-688-733-385; 007-392-844-248-218; 008-441-740-428-681; 009-260-589-053-461; 009-337-556-914-440; 010-224-235-707-058; 011-261-655-112-80X; 011-477-771-900-881; 012-237-139-955-786; 012-753-118-623-556; 012-969-327-796-851; 013-509-292-132-121; 013-882-694-743-06X; 014-011-723-933-624; 014-217-193-829-793; 014-856-995-085-766; 014-902-742-037-605; 016-029-808-791-627; 016-227-800-898-312; 016-968-275-868-331; 018-189-699-829-491; 020-054-602-790-230; 020-984-167-282-899; 021-122-440-762-146; 021-418-103-804-280; 021-492-268-017-010; 021-593-437-229-173; 021-839-480-001-665; 022-319-047-937-945; 022-890-754-072-998; 023-232-971-043-896; 023-255-468-485-04X; 024-025-030-147-196; 024-338-810-752-853; 024-566-307-385-640; 025-140-099-517-79X; 025-177-307-393-234; 025-180-032-572-598; 025-664-358-752-186; 025-722-211-126-765; 026-349-894-220-155; 026-641-277-662-255; 027-165-022-531-36X; 028-119-649-244-97X; 029-429-232-783-222; 029-715-662-130-00X; 029-780-004-772-247; 029-902-729-222-245; 029-939-055-924-644; 030-253-679-214-56X; 030-698-279-854-21X; 031-563-255-485-833; 032-423-195-871-143; 033-154-975-546-548; 035-639-350-985-872; 036-111-793-509-243; 036-630-775-495-188; 037-176-137-590-569; 038-761-877-951-407; 038-918-419-371-184; 039-808-003-086-733; 040-311-402-901-24X; 040-764-297-379-382; 041-179-937-541-720; 041-465-372-514-983; 041-653-816-222-307; 043-488-857-118-932; 044-084-703-828-881; 044-782-097-680-781; 046-764-674-703-052; 046-802-231-077-317; 047-080-347-855-146; 047-214-861-137-658; 047-427-822-197-710; 048-128-381-156-863; 048-352-666-575-427; 048-381-400-502-75X; 049-809-326-478-771; 050-500-920-633-711; 050-548-352-279-162; 050-674-076-901-636; 051-685-540-264-539; 052-820-333-124-969; 054-056-185-234-585; 054-861-001-755-039; 055-098-257-749-839; 055-344-025-845-654; 055-751-806-481-601; 056-416-247-183-592; 057-717-287-837-269; 058-074-377-687-989; 058-893-502-621-532; 059-200-603-733-279; 059-411-067-050-246; 059-705-167-797-906; 060-596-704-377-612; 061-090-158-839-24X; 062-809-259-818-094; 063-648-338-744-03X; 064-232-698-684-605; 067-216-474-109-838; 067-829-340-550-005; 068-201-478-987-587; 069-795-313-872-500; 070-051-589-921-215; 070-871-702-992-546; 071-070-126-521-442; 071-610-177-962-55X; 072-443-175-401-805; 072-552-961-072-669; 074-026-668-490-450; 075-083-201-647-271; 076-646-847-754-220; 077-017-125-873-644; 079-055-903-753-447; 080-250-182-901-786; 081-582-398-538-856; 082-026-757-777-701; 083-591-775-773-948; 084-346-800-352-895; 088-944-966-286-934; 089-364-659-117-765; 089-566-086-372-173; 090-658-648-593-191; 090-780-556-674-153; 091-772-949-068-29X; 095-373-280-320-891; 096-505-145-597-52X; 097-777-839-935-349; 099-068-919-319-862; 099-905-014-048-354; 100-872-250-775-268; 101-405-845-663-648; 101-739-991-445-438; 101-819-385-185-736; 102-066-240-030-920; 102-187-088-400-579; 102-190-961-184-792; 105-515-449-338-133; 105-868-787-713-227; 107-478-012-474-506; 107-882-390-328-332; 107-977-830-604-305; 109-507-186-371-673; 110-451-713-924-272; 111-023-040-153-949; 112-751-594-275-907; 114-216-258-364-386; 118-073-525-447-486; 120-315-177-143-435; 120-602-194-792-834; 130-283-942-427-574; 131-158-881-549-562; 131-273-280-869-118; 149-204-618-938-622; 162-627-358-368-891; 197-147-653-169-761,7

Shearing; Dan J. L. Brett,"Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach to generate ‘green’ hydrogen. The efficiency of this process relies on the effectiveness of the electrocatalysts used. The electro-kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly pH dependent and conventional catalysts typically are expensive and rare platinum-based materials. The development of low-cost, multi-component electrocatalysts, where each of the components has a synergistic effect, can be an effective approach to improve kinetics. Herein, a series of transition metal (Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni)-modified molybdenum carbides in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (TM-Mo2C@NCF) are synthesised to maximise exposed active sites. Among them, Fe-Mo2C@NCF delivers the best-in-class HER performance over a wide range of electrolytes. Tafel slopes of 76, 109 and 110 mV dec−1 and overpotentials of 65, 130 and 129 mV at 10 mA cm−2 were obtained in 1.0 M KOH, 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The computational study further indicates that the synergistic electronic modulation co-activated by Fe and N dopants in Fe-Mo2C@NCF can reduce the Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (ΔGH*) and render the Mo–Mo bridge site the most energetically favorable adsorption site for the H* intermediate, which contributes to an increased HER performance.",8,38,19879,19886,Adsorption; Catalysis; Tafel equation; Inorganic chemistry; Materials science; Electrocatalyst; Water splitting; Hydrogen; Electrochemistry; Electrolyte,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Science and Technology Facilities Council,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10111172/ https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/ta/d0ta07091b#! https://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/43121/ http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/ta/d0ta07091b https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2020/TA/D0TA07091B,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta07091b,,10.1039/d0ta07091b,3082721252,,0,002-576-124-236-90X; 002-997-861-112-187; 004-294-852-768-530; 004-308-254-649-173; 005-574-036-290-092; 006-899-986-793-998; 007-965-262-755-303; 012-078-018-759-388; 012-337-551-169-195; 012-946-261-543-998; 013-307-310-452-087; 013-776-863-379-221; 016-669-628-249-633; 017-207-993-846-92X; 023-046-388-296-862; 023-315-036-948-014; 023-563-933-533-575; 023-752-147-490-216; 024-611-478-043-880; 030-587-983-552-336; 031-241-382-663-522; 033-399-334-025-772; 034-699-851-280-609; 035-297-956-886-548; 037-144-003-081-893; 037-235-951-146-523; 037-803-601-601-170; 039-586-429-823-461; 039-737-530-700-234; 041-094-085-851-450; 042-939-915-784-348; 048-056-215-248-105; 048-513-462-179-97X; 049-208-954-752-758; 051-406-313-296-86X; 051-756-881-587-235; 052-102-085-978-87X; 053-716-429-223-968; 053-958-619-047-821; 054-151-446-022-720; 056-649-272-183-33X; 056-709-910-146-181; 057-889-863-470-444; 059-358-447-066-83X; 061-558-375-097-538; 062-296-222-799-992; 062-811-152-792-026; 064-397-889-974-934; 066-632-529-002-293; 069-335-509-807-287; 073-617-856-192-379; 077-402-093-380-95X; 078-174-782-100-452; 078-193-692-618-606; 083-208-603-356-473; 086-141-725-829-756; 096-906-871-210-761; 098-284-263-534-577; 099-621-454-051-261; 107-400-797-585-723; 116-983-567-488-526; 122-066-723-829-222; 122-135-351-418-508; 126-860-374-133-270; 129-445-215-700-398; 134-077-456-413-351; 150-642-057-199-57X; 162-425-303-711-052; 169-195-772-433-175,21

However, building up production capacities involves significant carbon production, especially when considering secondary infrastructure, e.g., renewable power sources. The amount of required capacity as well as the carbon production involved is calculated in this article. Using Germany as an example we show that the switch to purely green hydrogen involves significant bow waves in terms of carbon production as well as financial and resource demand. An economic model for an optimal decision is derived and—based on empirical estimates—calibrated. It shows that, even if green hydrogen is a competitive technology in the future, using alternatives like turquoise hydrogen or carbon capture and storage is necessary to significantly reduce or even avoid the mentioned bow waves.",14,18,5720,,Environmental economics; Optimal decision; Bow wave; Renewable energy; Carbon capture and storage; Production (economics); Environmental science; Hydrogen; Fossil fuel; Wind power,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/18/5720/pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jeners/v14y2021i18p5720-d633180.html https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/18/5720 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:gam:jeners:v:14:y:2021:i:18:p:5720-:d:633180,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14185720,,10.3390/en14185720,3201406338,,0,003-073-556-054-810; 003-438-944-110-81X; 003-475-432-050-051; 004-297-613-658-573; 004-639-935-570-985; 009-708-384-980-483; 011-924-681-851-387; 021-712-517-007-473; 026-779-469-943-555; 031-158-909-859-816; 037-357-606-039-853; 047-708-828-042-147; 049-655-772-403-754; 053-176-138-343-957; 054-996-062-420-580; 070-923-285-107-551; 086-596-642-766-201; 088-990-068-156-211; 096-423-229-364-169; 097-250-421-452-621; 097-404-249-996-123; 106-087-736-303-759; 106-753-851-788-546; 120-596-824-515-295; 133-196-479-995-505; 135-120-298-582-295; 139-024-705-049-101; 153-133-517-801-992; 159-209-425-293-907; 180-106-669-575-782,0

From this exothermic reaction, both hydrogen and the heat generated can be used. Due to the low price of aluminum chips, this allows us to produce Green hydrogen below the current price that is obtained using renewable energy sources and electrolyzers. On the other hand, we have developed a process that is sustainable since it is obtained as alumina and caustic soda waste that can be reused. This alumina obtained, once filtered, has high purity which allows us to produce high-quality primary aluminum without the need to use bauxite and reducing the production of red sludge. A comparative study-analysis has been carried out of two of the types of forms in which the most common aluminum is presented in the industry to analyze which one performs better by studying key factors such as the hydrogen produced, and the waste generated during the process. Finally, the mathematical model has been defined to be able to control the flow based on different key parameters such as temperature, molarity, and geometry. Undoubtedly, the study that we present represents a milestone for the recovery of metallic aluminum waste and may be of great interest to industries that use aluminum in their processes, such as recuperators, but also the vehicle or aerospace industry.</jats:p>",,,,,Metallurgy; Materials science; Scientific method; Breakage; Hydrogen; Aluminium,,,,,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202103.0546/v1/download https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202103.0546/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202103.0546.v1,,10.20944/preprints202103.0546.v1,3167481226,,0,,0

It took almost six decades to achieve 100 GW of solar energy capacity in 2012, but the 1 TW barrier is likely to be broken during 2022. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the overall investments in solar energy have increased by 12% to USD 148.6 billion (EUR 125 billion). In 2020, more than 135 GW of new solar photovoltaic electricity generation capacity was installed. The recovery of China, the continuous growths in Europe and the USA as well as new emerging markets were the main drivers. The number of countries installing more than 1 GW annually has increased to 18 in 2020. The continuation of price reductions in the battery storage sector has again resulted in a growing market for local battery storage systems in solar farms as well as decentralised photovoltaic electricity generation systems.

Current developments in water electrolysis for the production of hydrogen from renewable energy, focuses on improving costs and efficiencies. Bright Green Hydrogen, based in Methil, Fife, have set up a hydrogen demonstration project called the Levenmouth Community Energy Project (LCEP), to showcase and explore electrolytic hydrogen’s advantages as an energy storage system. The site has several measurement points to track performance of the system, with a range of resolutions available for the data. Research is ongoing to find locations and requirements where hydrogen storage for renewable energy is both technically and economically feasible. For this research, it is important that the resolution of the data is carefully considered to avoid losing important details, but also aiding in developing an efficient tool.

It may contribute to integrating variable renewable energy sources if production is sufficiently flexible in time. Using an open-source co-optimization model of the power sector and four options for supplying hydrogen at German filling stations, we find a trade-off between energy efficiency and temporal flexibility: for lower shares of renewables and hydrogen, more energy-efficient and less flexible small-scale on-site electrolysis is optimal. For higher shares of renewables and/or hydrogen, more flexible but less energy-efficient large-scale hydrogen supply chains gain importance as they allow disentangling hydrogen production from demand via storage. Liquid hydrogen emerges as particularly beneficial, followed by liquid organic hydrogen carriers and gaseous hydrogen. Large-scale hydrogen supply chains can deliver substantial power sector benefits, mainly through reduced renewable surplus generation. Energy modelers and system planners should consider the distinct flexibility characteristics of hydrogen supply chains in more detail when assessing the role of green hydrogen in future energy transition scenarios.",11,1,14191,,Supply chain; Environmental economics; Business; Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Efficient energy use; Energy transition; Liquid hydrogen; Variable renewable energy; Hydrogen; Supply chain; Environmental economics; Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Efficient energy use; Energy transition; Liquid hydrogen; Variable renewable energy; Environmental science; Hydrogen,,,,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung; Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung e.V.

Recently, various transition metal-based oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, and other chalcogenide-based materials have been synthesized for developing a suitable anode material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the various transition metal-based catalysts, their oxides have received much consideration for OER, especially in lower pH condition, and MnO2 is one of the oxides that have widely been used for the same. The large variation in the structural disorder of MnO2 and internal resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces have limited its large-scale application. By considering the above limitations of MnO2, here in this work, we have designed Ni-doped MnO2via a simple wet-chemical synthetic route, which has been successfully applied for OER application in 0.1 M KOH solution. Doping of various quantities of Ni into the MnO2 lattices improved the OER properties, and for achieving 10 mA/cm2 current density, the Ni-doped MnO2 containing 0.02 M of Ni2+ ions (coined as MnO2-Ni0.002(M)) demands only 445 mV overpotential, whereas the bare MnO2 required 610 mV overpotential. It has been proposed that the incorporation of nickel ions into the MnO2 lattices leads to an electron transfer from the Ni3+ ions to Mn4+, which in turn facilitates the Jahn-Teller distortion in the Mn-O octahedral unit. This electron transfer and the creation of a structural disorder in the Mn sites result in the improvization of the OER properties of the MnO2 materials.",60,24,19429,19439,Transition metal; Electron transfer; Oxygen evolution; Catalysis; Inorganic chemistry; Chemistry; Overpotential; Chalcogenide; Water splitting; Nickel,,,,DST New Delhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34821497 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03236,34821497,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03236,3217233374,,0,002-618-629-908-401; 003-197-548-977-396; 004-256-637-915-625; 004-782-673-190-254; 005-796-185-917-593; 010-440-178-683-737; 011-950-218-985-42X; 016-212-019-888-456; 017-602-595-973-771; 018-572-604-109-830; 019-120-545-789-934; 020-655-838-314-752; 022-574-314-228-130; 028-018-009-956-933; 028-991-656-770-670; 034-698-777-282-774; 037-792-420-911-486; 042-400-429-522-116; 045-006-580-558-676; 046-296-699-528-612; 047-782-106-977-544; 049-342-395-063-901; 051-250-100-261-307; 051-587-012-949-359; 054-518-901-691-087; 055-474-037-397-41X; 055-760-638-376-339; 058-040-152-726-806; 058-454-221-992-746; 059-968-899-105-914; 060-078-053-437-799; 062-757-849-687-483; 067-284-492-930-309; 067-906-434-878-833; 068-779-148-262-883; 070-263-730-475-475; 070-448-363-204-69X; 080-162-250-018-89X; 100-869-338-106-459; 101-805-931-515-150; 106-124-271-732-683; 134-644-535-789-355; 137-782-002-160-41X; 149-982-002-971-003; 151-922-549-875-784; 170-528-320-635-364; 171-498-645-148-857,3

In this work we show that anisotropic silver nanoparticles act as efficient catalysts for p-nitrophenol (Nip) reduction with glycerol, a renewable biomass byproduct, as the green hydrogen source. Anisotropic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were prepared using polyol method in presence of Cu2+ salt as an etchant. These AgNPs are found to be a combination of mixture of anisotropic shapes and spherical faceted nanoparticles. The percentage of anisotropic shapes in the distribution changes with amount of etchant used. Effect of shape and size of AgNPs on the catalytic kinetics of Nip reduction using glycerol as a hydrogen source was investigated. The AgNPs sample having more nanoparticles with anisotropy and finer average particle size exhibits better kinetics, lower activation energy and better turnover frequency (TOF).",6,105,103471,103477,Nanomaterials; Nanoparticle; Selective catalytic reduction; Catalysis; Inorganic chemistry; Particle size; Materials science; Transfer hydrogenation; Silver nanoparticle; Hydrogen,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6413718 https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ra/c6ra23676f#! http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C6RA23676F,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra23676f,,10.1039/c6ra23676f,2534029722,,0,001-536-795-867-443; 007-884-923-283-346; 008-353-974-004-03X; 010-612-828-738-460; 011-163-932-364-53X; 012-338-760-866-151; 014-589-152-525-176; 015-162-267-285-794; 015-635-022-974-441; 018-529-999-760-260; 020-172-510-286-739; 022-526-958-971-652; 023-750-671-382-925; 024-301-243-838-626; 029-970-029-646-754; 034-597-370-612-652; 037-750-458-130-997; 052-160-383-647-046; 058-546-968-903-13X; 067-661-969-739-802; 099-274-633-406-781; 099-915-998-062-624; 108-524-874-645-269; 109-060-457-978-12X; 115-206-959-375-851; 145-910-162-734-180; 155-795-220-228-406; 161-757-593-297-359,10

However, despite decades of research, advances at laboratory scale in terms of catalyst design and insights into underlying processes have not resulted in urgently needed improvements in water electrolyser performance or higher deployment rates. In light of recent developments in water electrolyser devices with modified architectures and designs integrating concepts from Li-ion or redox flow batteries, we discuss practical challenges hampering the scaling-up and large-scale deployment of water electrolysers. We highlight the role of device architectures and designs, and how engineering concepts deserve to be integrated into fundamental research to accelerate synergies between materials science and engineering, and also to achieve industry-scale deployment. New devices require benchmarking and assessment in terms of not only their performance metrics, but also their scalability and deployment potential.",19,11,1140,1150,Software deployment; Secondary sector of the economy; Hydrogen production; Process engineering; Laboratory scale; Scalability; Benchmarking,,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche (French National Research Agency) (ANR-17-CE05-0008); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (French National Research Agency) (ANR-10-LABX-0076),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33020614/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatMa..19.1140L/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020614 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03000043/document https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03000043 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-020-0788-3.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-020-0788-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41563-020-0788-3,33020614,10.1038/s41563-020-0788-3,3090555410,,0,001-940-617-630-704; 002-723-465-429-790; 004-689-301-936-127; 006-627-180-834-51X; 009-357-321-298-848; 009-723-135-898-820; 010-067-507-695-681; 010-710-819-313-144; 013-060-475-357-414; 013-196-476-992-033; 013-443-593-774-698; 013-495-464-518-262; 014-883-222-384-688; 015-118-064-149-321; 017-817-333-022-579; 018-733-867-992-914; 019-343-859-934-063; 019-817-476-241-261; 021-039-082-428-959; 023-654-154-002-058; 024-318-443-821-950; 025-782-950-198-011; 028-934-480-053-115; 029-193-321-442-317; 029-592-802-463-811; 029-699-478-466-884; 031-500-550-978-667; 038-467-119-234-903; 040-294-509-904-879; 041-456-203-936-435; 043-333-407-517-665; 044-912-511-398-769; 044-950-393-162-276; 045-529-061-209-557; 047-818-586-878-87X; 051-219-068-914-703; 052-762-944-280-888; 054-045-806-139-190; 056-889-178-289-907; 058-670-023-859-940; 059-789-181-292-024; 061-149-949-847-266; 062-037-286-886-095; 063-612-102-685-622; 065-105-802-572-545; 066-048-278-915-545; 069-252-660-439-903; 069-543-489-283-741; 069-566-059-325-050; 071-240-505-997-407; 074-234-518-701-941; 083-577-046-450-013; 091-327-648-108-547; 094-355-445-847-873; 102-410-676-483-859; 107-355-363-762-585; 107-632-503-856-122; 111-695-245-786-637; 118-470-710-324-102; 119-683-432-009-289; 122-578-610-114-692; 122-693-222-989-175; 146-278-219-008-973; 152-467-694-743-141; 155-272-948-691-716; 157-077-844-809-651; 167-334-218-945-151; 183-191-873-808-721,78

What is essential from the perspective of further gas use is the parameter describing a ratio of equilibrium concentration of hydrogen to carbon monoxide (H/C=xH2/xCO). The parameter is determined by operating temperature and the initial ratio of steam concentration to methane SC=xH2O0/xCH40. In this paper, the author presents a thermodynamic analysis of the effect of green hydrogen addition to a fuel mixture on the steam methane reforming process of gaseous phase (CH4/H2)–H2O. The thermodynamic analysis of conversion of hydrogen-enriched methane (CH4/H2)–H2O has been performed using parametric equation formalism, allowing for determining the equilibrium composition of the process in progress. A thermodynamic condition of carbon precipitation in methane reforming (CH4/H2) with the gaseous phase of H2O has been interpreted. The ranges of substrate concentrations creating carbon deposition for temperature T = 1000 K have been determined, based on the technologies used. The results obtained can serve as a model basis for describing the properties of steam reforming of methane and hydrogen mixture (CH4/H2)–H2O.",14,20,6564,,Catalysis; Materials science; Methane reformer; Syngas; Steam reforming; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Hydrogen; Methane; Thermodynamics,,,,Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/20/6564 https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jeners/v14y2021i20p6564-d654669.html https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/20/6564/pdf https://www.h2knowledgecentre.com/content/journal2542,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14206564,,10.3390/en14206564,3206869600,,0,004-568-155-787-90X; 005-438-361-494-21X; 008-194-485-229-670; 009-392-068-563-559; 010-704-170-399-877; 012-420-049-781-503; 016-837-345-260-787; 016-874-342-168-267; 020-123-463-839-351; 020-483-287-235-418; 030-572-974-356-059; 036-101-755-165-751; 043-722-471-289-854; 047-455-924-266-375; 050-516-122-653-722; 050-932-371-899-523; 052-456-327-139-410; 053-007-906-228-445; 053-788-409-727-176; 056-375-832-540-046; 057-465-423-854-613; 064-062-390-485-563; 066-331-115-785-786; 068-080-514-312-432; 071-224-077-138-904; 074-546-705-670-434; 081-432-601-931-749; 087-801-301-141-808; 089-997-495-495-881; 093-845-143-640-880; 098-003-381-048-453; 098-501-922-399-072; 103-207-203-825-778; 105-967-208-854-601; 112-124-563-846-153; 119-082-324-516-415; 120-123-775-671-004; 121-955-480-607-927; 122-260-640-660-731; 127-791-141-331-911; 136-463-615-915-999; 151-619-207-581-362; 153-604-021-933-148; 161-935-939-710-307; 168-964-223-554-879,0

But that’s only if industry can eliminate the 830 million metric tons of carbon dioxide generated every year to make hydrogen, mostly from the steam reformation of methane. Carbon sequestration costs could decline enough to make “blue” hydrogen—hydrogen for which all carbon emissions from production are captured and stored or reused—affordable by 2030, the IEA says.

Direct reduced iron (DRI) can be used after briquetting in form of HBI in the blast furnace to decrease the consumption of coke and/or pulverized coal as well as to increase the production of hot metal.,164,7,267,273,Steelmaking; Direct reduced iron; Blast furnace; Coke; Environmental science; Pulverized coal-fired boiler; Hydrogen; Waste management; Natural gas,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00501-019-0865-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00501-019-0865-6,,10.1007/s00501-019-0865-6,2952375202,,0,,1

Al Bacha; Isabelle Aubert; M. Zakhour; Michel Nakhl; J.-L. Bobet,"Abstract The hydrolysis of Mg-based materials appears to be an ideal solution for clean energy production. Green hydrogen was produced by the hydrolysis reaction of a “standard” AZ91 alloy (called AZ91 in the following) in “model” seawater solution. Two milling speeds (i.e. 250 rpm and 350 rpm) were tested to enhance the reactivity of AZ91. Graphite and AlCl3 were used as ball milling additives. Milling at higher rotational speed is more energetic, hence it ameliorates the most the hydrolysis performance of AZ91. Comparing both milling additives, AlCl3 enhances the most the hydrolysis of AZ91 with a generation of 65% of its theoretical H2 generation capacity. The best material was obtained by milling AZ91 at 350 rpm with graphite for 2 h followed by a further milling with AlCl3 for 2 h – a yield of 75% of its theoretical H2 generation capacity was reached within a few minutes. The corrosion behavior of milled AZ91 was investigated by anodic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The calculated electrochemical parameters from EIS fitting of two materials milled under different conditions but with the same milling additive are approximately the same. This suggests that, in order to fully evaluate the reactivity of AZ91, hydrolysis, anodic polarization and EIS must be considered.",9,6,1942,1953,Ball mill; Reactivity (chemistry); Materials science; Hydrogen production; Polarization (electrochemistry); Graphite; Chemical engineering; Hydrogen; Dielectric spectroscopy; Hydrolysis,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213956721000177 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213956721000177,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jma.2020.12.007,,10.1016/j.jma.2020.12.007,3134109918,,0,001-032-903-647-597; 001-053-464-159-497; 001-137-302-862-292; 002-632-632-179-482; 003-407-235-709-326; 005-438-361-494-21X; 005-774-575-595-932; 007-515-453-086-298; 007-786-983-932-767; 009-459-827-893-246; 009-566-651-327-024; 010-714-057-730-379; 014-514-027-165-048; 019-891-473-256-981; 020-385-098-499-263; 022-522-068-177-897; 022-949-841-452-247; 022-962-619-866-541; 023-959-321-593-21X; 026-220-955-804-22X; 028-833-124-056-077; 031-704-977-697-340; 034-706-325-420-387; 038-883-541-316-800; 039-336-862-086-237; 041-527-724-875-995; 044-183-367-244-513; 044-540-898-417-017; 044-589-820-552-259; 045-631-852-907-555; 046-968-712-284-149; 047-519-745-379-585; 047-571-629-344-025; 053-857-203-228-685; 054-875-676-608-413; 054-990-842-468-705; 055-604-743-818-413; 056-278-489-566-622; 059-652-461-798-743; 061-365-837-631-942; 063-437-642-491-540; 067-409-498-102-623; 072-411-282-209-185; 076-632-481-653-902; 081-419-840-563-06X; 084-722-416-535-298; 089-096-747-302-866; 089-524-409-506-434; 090-022-221-054-443; 092-043-320-713-040; 093-440-391-898-404; 095-378-989-851-684; 098-650-460-935-457; 102-056-230-586-926; 107-735-847-406-67X; 108-521-515-938-381; 111-743-059-102-493; 117-382-699-706-831; 121-837-000-733-223; 124-359-576-457-466; 135-740-401-808-481; 146-491-796-395-646; 163-097-774-980-343,0

Ammar,"<jats:p>Marine diesel engines are facing challenges to cope with the emission-reduction regulations set by the international maritime organization (IMO). Hydrogen fuel is one of the alternative fuels which can be used to reduce the exhaust gas;             emissions from ships. The current paper investigates the effect of using diesel-hydrogen dual fuels on the environmental, energetic and exergetic performance parameters of slow speed marine diesel engine. The investigation is performed using;             Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software package. As a case study, slow speed diesel engine has been investigated. The results obtained revealed that the energetic and exergetic parameters are influenced by engine load and hydrogen substitution;             percent. The exergy efficiency is increased by 3.65%, 8.20%, 13.99%, and 21.7% for the hydrogen substitution percentages of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively compared with the diesel engine at full load. Environmentally, CO and CO2 emissions are;             reduced and NOx emissions are increased as the hydrogen energy content increases. Dual fuel engine with input hydrogen energy fractions of 10% and 20% will comply with the required NOx emission regulations set by IMO after using selective catalytic;             reduction (SCR) system. It will comply with the required regulations with relative percentages of 96.4% and 98.4%, respectively.</jats:p>",6,6,,,Automotive engineering; Environmental analysis; Efficient energy use; Diesel engine; Slow speed; Environmental science; Hydrogen,,,,,http://ijmcr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper101347-1356.pdf http://ijmcr.com/energy-efficiency-and-environmental-analysis-of-the-green-hydrogen-fueled-slow-speed-marine-diesel-engine/,http://dx.doi.org/10.14741/ijmcr/v.6.6.10,,10.14741/ijmcr/v.6.6.10,2913005677,,0,000-619-597-968-072; 001-072-679-994-362; 006-585-387-064-839; 007-536-168-249-265; 008-224-118-124-716; 008-737-341-450-032; 009-548-825-107-357; 009-988-496-984-007; 010-526-955-687-079; 012-971-012-678-204; 013-719-204-012-732; 014-270-345-130-58X; 022-367-411-978-564; 024-882-548-084-616; 029-285-710-475-153; 031-904-253-398-464; 033-138-962-097-894; 037-793-629-438-372; 039-741-873-085-52X; 040-969-931-069-322; 041-347-742-898-850; 042-586-259-853-278; 042-660-580-279-914; 047-443-894-492-620; 048-033-358-904-702; 048-532-797-127-630; 050-851-419-912-287; 051-159-670-622-533; 053-082-472-636-993; 053-171-187-535-522; 056-770-812-660-905; 057-043-343-148-727; 064-261-303-648-267; 066-204-939-151-477; 068-248-962-699-163; 069-493-072-486-022; 070-407-320-712-650; 073-576-379-663-511; 073-768-571-944-280; 077-782-782-654-351; 085-460-365-841-963; 088-280-607-166-739; 088-698-466-393-302; 096-856-108-191-066; 106-275-878-430-76X; 107-964-700-055-659; 109-509-732-683-922; 124-462-562-154-232; 126-240-684-072-509; 145-314-781-122-393; 148-843-805-666-591; 151-049-533-133-002; 155-532-545-665-386; 158-442-857-350-631; 158-623-251-635-520; 164-204-398-229-907; 171-133-834-362-578,1
007-971-883-978-99X,Going from Green Hydrogen to Blue hydrogen for our blue earth.,2020-08-29,2020,,,,,,Sofoklis Makridis,"“Black”, “grey” or “brown” refer emissions to the production of hydrogen from coal, natural gas and lignite, respectively. “Blue” is commonly used for the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels with CO2 reduced by the use of carbon capture, use and Storage (CCUS). “Green” is a term applied to production of hydrogen from renewable electricity. In general, there are no established colors for hydrogen from biomass, nuclear or different varieties of grid electricity. As the environmental impacts of each of these production routes can vary considerably by energy source, region and type of CCUS applied. Building novel blue communities need to be oriented in buildings. Stationary fuel cells are units that provide electricity (and sometimes heat) but are not designed to be moved. These include combined heat and power (CHP), uninterruptible power systems (UPS) and primary power units. The heat produced as a by-product of combined heat and power is used to cover part of the buildings heat demand. The mostly electricity-led mode of operation results in a low thermal output from fuel cell heating systems. The remaining heat requirement of the building is covered by an additional heating system, e.g. a condensing boiler. For that reason, fuel cells are particularly suitable for buildings with a low space heating requirement, such as low-energy or nearly zero-energy buildings. In buildings with a higher space heating requirement, hybrid fuel cell heating systems, comprising a fuel cell and a condensing boiler to cover peak heating requirements, are used. Stationary fuel cells in the output range up to 10 kWe are usually PEM or SO fuel cells. The typical CHP output range for houses and apartment buildings is 0.7 to 5 kWe. Probably the biggest advantage of fuel cells over thermal power processes is the direct electrochemical conversion during electricity and heat generation and the associated higher electrical efficiency. In combined mode, i.e. electrical and thermal, fuel cells can achieve efficiencies of up to 95 %. The electrical efficiency is up to 45 %. Furthermore, fuel cell systems are characterized by high efficiencies over all load points, they are quiet, have low maintenance costs and operate (locally) emission-free.",10,3,17,,Renewable energy; Thermal power station; Heating system; Condensing boiler; Energy source; Heat generation; Waste management; Natural gas; Fossil fuel,,,,,https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/going-from-green-hydrogen-to-blue-hydrogen-for-our-blue-earth-14341.html,https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/going-from-green-hydrogen-to-blue-hydrogen-for-our-blue-earth-14341.html,,,3082805660,,0,,0

With emerging electro-energetic systems with a large share of renewable sources, hydrogen is also becoming an important energy carrier, which with the possibility of storing surplus energy ensures greater stability of power system operation and energy supply. Therefore, the use of electricity from renewable sources is important for the production of green hydrogen using electrolysis. The first part of the article describes the possibilities for hydrogen cogeneration in one of the run-of-river hydropower plants in Slovenia. The implementation costs of the necessary equipment for hydrogen production in the case-study power plant, its production costs and the profitability of hydrogen production compared to the sale of electricity are estimated. The criteria according to which the production of hydrogen is more profitable than the sale of electricity at current prices and guaranteed sales is also defined. In the second part of the article, a scenario for the use of hydrogen for heating and mobility needs in the nearby local community is presented. For the regular supply of hydrogen in the range of up to 30 kg/h, the necessary investment costs for the installation of the appropriate equipment in the hydropower plant are calculated along with an estimation of the payback period of the investment.",10,,100081,,Environmental economics; Business; Payback period; Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Energy supply; Cogeneration; Hydropower; Power station; Energy carrier,,,,"Ministrstvo za Izobraževanje, Znanost in Šport; ARRS",https://www.h2knowledgecentre.com/content/journal2010 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590174521000064 https://doaj.org/article/48d9e644c4804e71963baddcaca49c6f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecmx.2021.100081,,10.1016/j.ecmx.2021.100081,3155127568,,0,005-675-826-003-281; 007-383-662-887-815; 010-694-466-229-379; 011-854-795-650-013; 015-205-835-544-705; 018-990-530-651-273; 021-253-767-394-269; 022-574-314-228-130; 022-789-141-874-887; 030-570-552-214-940; 036-474-979-582-548; 039-734-358-547-608; 045-515-948-448-535; 060-439-614-283-605; 077-298-942-408-957; 088-563-694-937-406; 094-057-717-062-864; 095-604-342-099-658; 107-920-287-282-641; 109-488-421-033-156; 110-207-608-447-73X; 114-312-581-804-716; 124-830-045-385-952,1

Brent; Jim Hinkley,"This study examined the feasibility of green hydrogen as a transport fuel for the very heavy vehicle (VHV) fleet in New Zealand. Green hydrogen is assumed to be produced through water electrolysis using purely renewable energy (RE) as an electricity source. This study chose very heavy vehicles as a potential market for green hydrogen, because it is considered “low-hanging fruit” for hydrogen fuel in a sector where battery electrification is less feasible. The study assumed a large-scale, decentralized, embedded (dedicated) grid-connected hydrogen system of production using polymer electrolytic membrane (PEM) electrolysers. The analysis comprised three steps. First, the hydrogen demand was calculated. Second, the additional RE requirement was determined and compared with consented, but unbuilt, capacity. Finally, the hydrogen production cost was calculated using the concept of levelized cost. Sensitivity analysis and cost reduction scenarios were also undertaken. The results indicate an overall green hydrogen demand for VHVs of 71 million kg, or 8.5 PJ, per year, compared to the 14.7 PJ of diesel fuel demand for the same VHV travelled kilometres. The results also indicate that the estimated 9824 GWh of RE electricity that could be generated from consented, yet unbuilt, RE projects is greater than the electricity demand for green hydrogen production, which was calculated to be 4492 GWh. The calculated levelized hydrogen cost is NZD 6.83/kg. Electricity cost was found to be the most significant cost parameter for green hydrogen production. A combined cost reduction for CAPEX and electricity translates to a hydrogen cost reduction in 10 to 20 years.",14,9,2636,,Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Electricity; Cost reduction; Environmental science; Electrolysis of water; Hydrogen; Waste management; Cost of electricity by source; Hydrogen fuel,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:gam:jeners:v:14:y:2021:i:9:p:2636-:d:548861 https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jeners/v14y2021i9p2636-d548861.html https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/9/2636 https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/9/2636/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14092636,,10.3390/en14092636,3158047143,,0,011-276-883-713-860; 012-024-562-515-551; 015-007-798-278-868; 017-406-284-865-310; 027-871-571-883-454; 031-998-605-209-672; 038-455-374-243-50X; 038-511-465-196-319; 049-292-828-517-065; 050-433-847-622-399; 051-819-161-597-780; 056-090-318-021-957; 061-974-508-953-362; 067-613-642-167-105; 076-437-249-230-522; 078-872-570-716-288; 083-001-748-523-73X; 083-166-436-231-75X; 084-896-599-112-334; 085-806-123-912-437,2

Khalil,"This simulation-based comparative assessment aims to quantify the environmental and human-health impacts of greener hydrogen (H2) production via three glycerol-based technologies, including: supercritical water reforming (SCWR), aqueous-phase reforming (APR) and autothermal reforming (ATR). The GaBi (2018 edition) life-cycle assessment (LCA) platform is used to develop cradle-to-gate product system models for these technologies and the TRACI 2.1 methodology is used to quantify their midpoint impact categories. Aspen HYSYS (v11) process-simulation software is used to generate the life-cycle inventory (LCI) primary data required to produce 1 kg of H2 via each of the indicated glycerol-reforming technologies. Per ISO 14040:2006 reporting requirements for the LCA results interpretation step, three base case (BC) scenarios and four sensitivity scenarios (SS) are developed and quantified to compare the effects of different process electricity sources (US grid mix versus wind power) and thermal energy sources (natural gas versus biogas) on the LCA results. The high operating pressure (viz. 240 bar) of SCWR enabled assessment of the impact of in situ electricity generation to offset some of electricity required for this technology. The major insights from this research are as follows: (i) per 1 kg of produced H2, APR reduces CO2 emissions by ≈95% compared to ATR and by ≈92% compared to SCWR, (ii) for BC scenarios, the primary energy consumption (in MJ/kg of produced H2) is in the following order from highest to lowest: ATR > SCWR > APR and (iii) H2 production via glycerol APR is more environmentally sustainable than SCWR and ATR, and thus offers a promising path for greener H2 production. Future environmental sustainability studies should focus on expanding the scope of this study to include H2 production via water electrolysis using renewable electricity sources and via solar and nuclear-driven thermochemical water splitting.",5,3,387,402,Thermal energy; Renewable energy; Methane reformer; Electricity; Environmental science; Electricity generation; Waste management; Natural gas; Biogas; Wind power,,,,,https://www.scilit.net/article/47d8beaf8ec200fabd8f320e5a591ae5 https://academic.oup.com/ce/article/5/3/387/6317702 http://academic.oup.com/ce/article/5/3/387/6317702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ce/zkab018,,10.1093/ce/zkab018,3178129099,,0,004-701-158-348-099; 007-314-461-378-919; 007-727-580-544-575; 007-892-769-640-981; 010-329-377-006-100; 023-364-001-969-131; 027-979-266-904-305; 028-332-398-566-415; 029-931-749-663-497; 031-272-176-541-518; 035-797-243-091-009; 041-309-727-690-341; 043-306-869-956-036; 043-942-098-772-841; 048-876-629-489-746; 059-584-984-273-59X; 066-633-291-457-558; 075-123-940-620-148; 079-676-556-501-035; 080-645-552-035-106; 083-012-993-318-928; 087-611-501-104-57X; 094-832-424-280-029; 098-364-424-526-448; 102-467-951-537-792; 103-301-749-295-298; 120-624-309-055-250; 140-752-343-651-226; 141-176-151-592-528; 157-893-781-862-628,0

To address this issue, there is a growing body of research on renewable resources such as biomass, of which cellulose is the most abundant type. In particular, the electrochemical reforming of biomass is especially promising, as it allows greater control over valorization processes and requires milder conditions. Driven by renewable electricity, electroreforming of biomass can be green and sustainable. Moreover, green hydrogen generation can be coupled to anodic biomass electroforming, which has attracted ever-increasing attention. The following review is a summary of recent developments related to electroreforming cellulose and its derivatives (glucose, hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid). The electroreforming of biomass can be achieved on the anode of an electrochemical cell through electrooxidation, as well as on the cathode through electroreduction. Recent advances in the anodic electroreforming of cellulose and cellulose-derived glucose and 5-hydrooxylmethoylfurural (5-HMF) are first summarized. Then, the key achievements in the cathodic electroreforming of cellulose and cellulose-derived 5-HMF and levulinic acid are discussed. Afterward, the emerging research focusing on coupling hydrogen evolution with anodic biomass reforming for the cogeneration of green hydrogen fuel and value-added chemicals is reviewed. The final chapter of this paper provides our perspective on the challenges and future research directions of biomass electroreforming.",12,11,1405,,Renewable resource; Renewable energy; Hydrogen production; Biomass; Levulinic acid; Environmental science; Pulp and paper industry; Fossil fuel; Value added; Hydrogen fuel,biomass electroreforming; cellulose; electrochemical hydrogenation; electrooxidation; green hydrogen,,,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A1983c0029); Ministry of Education (RG58_21)",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/12/11/1405/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/12/11/1405,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/mi12111405,34832816,10.3390/mi12111405,3214539873,PMC8619709,0,001-008-779-389-171; 001-312-718-277-914; 001-837-305-058-571; 003-588-245-552-743; 005-496-088-984-431; 007-022-805-434-159; 007-380-437-560-273; 008-159-329-009-023; 008-335-606-721-087; 008-487-198-594-586; 009-432-519-544-95X; 010-384-817-918-421; 010-803-748-381-109; 011-003-884-876-844; 012-105-098-815-87X; 012-795-196-011-315; 012-993-481-791-194; 014-520-149-498-415; 014-559-576-113-143; 014-576-895-234-035; 014-746-590-435-986; 016-597-456-340-966; 016-761-780-955-913; 016-927-301-285-631; 017-643-148-174-91X; 017-946-215-063-223; 018-042-004-336-775; 018-500-819-100-400; 019-506-422-009-821; 019-754-341-381-720; 020-175-765-508-333; 020-854-068-932-651; 022-928-697-281-910; 024-414-012-251-466; 025-712-954-941-649; 025-717-027-872-374; 025-787-611-256-662; 026-733-304-489-08X; 027-037-823-707-525; 027-331-693-509-156; 029-305-962-915-501; 030-444-595-597-307; 030-542-421-513-248; 031-269-218-140-476; 032-262-589-672-222; 033-452-623-756-109; 033-740-568-341-539; 033-856-287-764-986; 034-959-341-471-761; 035-251-420-499-239; 037-552-100-953-430; 039-810-886-597-440; 040-045-375-179-546; 040-264-748-392-762; 040-519-319-024-111; 041-784-843-474-884; 044-026-641-380-050; 045-407-935-158-653; 045-889-572-743-718; 047-867-092-179-543; 050-251-478-909-281; 054-043-056-012-49X; 055-535-725-092-771; 059-611-062-661-327; 062-358-188-049-258; 063-105-374-881-962; 063-220-147-832-267; 064-055-985-655-626; 066-202-726-373-093; 070-254-528-216-141; 070-909-290-723-083; 071-324-660-247-401; 072-350-324-111-973; 073-330-721-577-417; 074-253-081-668-125; 074-325-195-031-499; 074-779-916-702-042; 075-620-774-969-56X; 079-956-296-481-993; 080-753-794-306-042; 083-545-029-529-540; 089-153-717-115-435; 092-141-878-429-62X; 092-249-743-849-779; 095-451-905-304-981; 095-791-978-852-031; 097-006-051-278-659; 099-048-184-068-987; 100-555-597-285-517; 102-570-513-921-263; 105-335-249-189-294; 105-515-945-629-933; 108-083-669-454-139; 111-831-790-265-320; 114-430-985-521-330; 114-635-834-993-284; 115-966-530-274-232; 117-226-320-563-385; 118-088-986-598-481; 119-484-661-137-813; 128-531-139-093-868; 139-896-229-385-216; 142-276-622-021-268; 143-829-892-039-306; 148-042-756-270-426; 148-500-088-228-876; 151-835-560-575-568; 154-242-774-559-462; 159-859-231-092-191; 160-182-387-018-338; 166-674-663-226-213; 181-339-692-276-354; 182-731-175-345-924; 197-070-131-561-982,0

Incremental changes in present primary steel production technologies would not be sufficient to meet the emission reduction targets. Replacing coke, used in the blast furnaces as a reducing agent, with hydrogen produced from water electrolysis has the potential to reduce emissions from iron and steel production substantially. Mass and energy flow model based on an open-source software (Python) has been developed in this work to explore the feasibility of using hydrogen direct reduction of iron ore (HDRI) coupled with electric arc furnace (EAF) for carbon-free steel production. Modeling results show that HDRI-EAF technology could reduce specific emissions from steel production in the EU by more than 35 % , at present grid emission levels (295 kgCO2/MWh). The energy consumption for 1 ton of liquid steel (tls) production through the HDRI-EAF route was found to be 3.72 MWh, which is slightly more than the 3.48 MWh required for steel production through the blast furnace (BF) basic oxygen furnace route (BOF). Pellet making and steel finishing processes have not been considered. Sensitivity analysis revealed that electrolyzer efficiency is the most important factor affecting the system energy consumption, while the grid emission factor is strongly correlated with the overall system emissions.",13,3,758,,Electrolysis; Electric arc furnace; Iron ore; Energy consumption; Blast furnace; Coke; Environmental science; Hydrogen; Waste management; Basic oxygen steelmaking,,,,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/3/758 https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jeners/v13y2020i3p758-d318367.html https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/3/758/pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/article/gamjeners/v_3a13_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a758-_3ad_3a318367.htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13030758,,10.3390/en13030758,3004437992,,0,000-534-259-826-343; 001-362-501-626-496; 003-561-919-967-831; 005-235-860-148-768; 007-902-046-381-847; 008-898-521-715-883; 010-451-791-443-487; 013-246-343-148-034; 013-667-580-471-594; 013-984-714-694-275; 018-431-554-890-112; 028-433-787-900-221; 028-841-162-154-460; 029-029-002-740-224; 032-737-645-490-623; 034-124-699-194-740; 042-055-187-973-760; 054-073-935-224-269; 056-601-692-868-885; 057-925-133-190-112; 060-949-987-588-110; 063-097-594-732-806; 064-199-571-769-685; 065-792-277-769-047; 065-930-441-037-925; 068-468-278-749-384; 070-974-756-184-52X; 072-298-962-250-34X; 076-658-792-106-338; 079-659-171-464-873; 079-741-431-206-436; 082-403-223-778-41X; 094-047-030-446-424; 098-339-441-895-777; 098-423-514-381-833; 098-961-326-552-947; 100-271-334-627-111; 101-334-079-866-212; 117-856-566-119-133; 119-572-790-495-473; 147-750-295-391-700; 163-987-793-034-226; 179-989-411-988-930,50

Herein, a countrywide supply chain analysis of Germany, spanning until 2050, is applied to investigate promising infrastructure development pathways and associated hydrogen distribution costs for each analyzed hydrogen market. Analyzed supply chain pathways include seasonal storage to balance fluctuating renewable power generation with necessary purification, as well as trailer- and pipeline-based hydrogen delivery. The analysis encompasses green hydrogen feedstock in the chemical industry and fuel cell-based mobility applications, such as local buses, non-electrified regional trains, material handling vehicles, and trucks, as well as passenger cars. Our results indicate that the utilization of low-cost, long-term storage and improved refueling station utilization have the highest impact during the market introduction phase. We find that public transport and captive fleets offer a cost-efficient countrywide renewable hydrogen supply roll-out option. Furthermore, we show that, at comparable effective carbon tax resulting from the current energy tax rates in Germany, hydrogen is cost-competitive in the transportation sector by the year 2025. Moreover, we show that sector-specific CO2 taxes are required to provide a cost-competitive green hydrogen supply in both the transportation and industrial sectors.",12,24,4707,,Supply chain; Environmental economics; Business; Secondary sector of the economy; Renewable energy; Niche market; Fuel cell bus; Carbon tax; Truck; Public transport,,,,Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Association,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/24/4707/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/24/4707 https://www.h2knowledgecentre.com/content/journal2516 https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jeners/v12y2019i24p4707-d296287.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12244707,,10.3390/en12244707,2994892245,,0,000-055-047-868-818; 000-811-317-987-00X; 003-722-870-025-265; 004-384-839-833-202; 004-863-854-190-258; 005-383-706-524-07X; 005-500-317-409-211; 005-675-826-003-281; 006-411-589-714-14X; 011-440-390-887-282; 014-487-699-359-581; 015-772-107-681-50X; 019-655-367-866-546; 021-494-458-567-223; 022-676-398-099-029; 025-018-263-444-053; 031-811-475-663-398; 032-548-593-710-483; 034-124-699-194-740; 036-245-576-216-536; 036-574-782-884-102; 039-081-783-062-016; 039-821-989-710-200; 046-445-327-787-150; 048-237-393-225-101; 048-849-368-657-559; 049-923-519-693-186; 050-424-921-205-282; 054-069-006-915-282; 054-836-129-762-700; 057-889-144-846-919; 061-961-917-452-566; 071-135-717-678-710; 073-406-300-173-463; 073-929-095-685-971; 075-533-484-177-411; 075-870-467-754-472; 076-578-930-165-177; 078-777-539-435-888; 081-659-358-084-979; 081-891-419-397-482; 083-453-640-106-704; 084-873-500-084-520; 086-737-545-708-612; 087-780-948-443-081; 090-337-726-421-217; 090-708-170-903-498; 092-342-964-126-60X; 092-556-941-670-075; 094-017-569-802-296; 097-681-336-116-812; 098-961-326-552-947; 099-402-738-841-492; 101-519-145-083-568; 101-858-508-751-657; 102-261-919-582-901; 103-444-023-438-550; 112-516-913-788-508; 112-628-953-075-541; 115-122-129-526-544; 117-276-231-067-705; 117-860-143-303-125; 117-961-043-406-226; 118-895-321-976-901; 119-959-279-969-412; 122-270-646-188-617; 124-856-910-400-981; 125-296-075-774-771; 132-618-165-983-115; 135-040-989-854-667; 143-338-800-720-625; 149-963-639-789-176; 175-801-375-663-000; 181-772-507-007-206; 193-595-455-714-267; 199-500-306-375-381,19
