000-054-930-328-103,Perspectives of Nano-Carbon Based Engineering Materials†,2014-05-26,2014,journal article,Advanced Engineering Materials,14381656; 15272648,Wiley,United Kingdom,Peter Greil,"Nano-carbon materials attained considerable scientific interest due to their unique physico-chemical properties. Much less reports can be found on transferring the unique properties of super-strong individual nanoparticles like carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoplatelets into load bearing engineering materials. After reviewing structure and properties of nano-carbon properties the size effect governing the reduction of inherent mechanical properties upon transfer into macroscopic engineering materials is considered. While the potential of mechanical property enhancement of composites with random orientation of elongated carbon nanoparticles is limited by very low percolation thresholds, manufacturing of aligned microstructures, and tailoring of nanoparticle/matrix interface offers plenty of space for optimizing the mechanical properties of composites subjected to tensile loads. Since compression is the more common loading situation for ultra low-density nano-carbon materials the collapse stress is important for deriving design limits of nanoporous carbon materials. At the same level of density materials with nanotube or sheet carbon allotropes forming the struts may be expected to achieve a compression strength orders of magnitude higher than the porous graphitic materials. Finally, economic aspects of nano-carbon manufacturing are discussed.",17,2.0,124.0,137.0,Ultimate tensile strength; Nanoparticle; Composite material; Nanotechnology; Materials science; Percolation threshold; Nanotube; Compressive strength; Carbon; Carbon nanotube; Porosity,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.201400110,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adem.201400110,,10.1002/adem.201400110,2157931409,,0,000-289-398-938-138; 000-301-196-136-443; 000-610-633-073-751; 000-672-679-241-486; 002-531-792-890-414; 002-778-220-807-616; 003-508-989-695-365; 003-830-473-353-984; 006-392-346-465-387; 006-470-893-976-961; 006-589-028-556-434; 007-505-710-822-219; 008-483-053-086-064; 011-729-177-831-13X; 011-887-492-362-664; 012-325-097-969-054; 012-353-147-982-90X; 012-445-185-522-451; 013-389-788-493-816; 014-662-820-947-699; 016-561-801-903-850; 017-774-356-465-527; 018-841-520-539-414; 019-553-833-428-483; 019-894-653-012-195; 020-397-274-571-26X; 020-883-759-189-927; 021-121-933-525-291; 022-848-208-927-953; 022-909-599-690-469; 025-397-970-998-437; 027-145-589-588-06X; 027-996-895-789-375; 029-285-038-759-800; 031-207-718-332-665; 032-032-223-981-975; 032-248-811-381-549; 034-144-146-478-311; 036-117-756-521-400; 037-743-812-649-64X; 037-850-924-395-713; 038-034-393-865-480; 038-515-270-181-158; 039-548-366-937-519; 039-847-269-524-392; 040-206-597-439-205; 041-820-700-928-83X; 043-605-045-484-451; 044-376-761-094-411; 044-890-111-754-504; 045-156-777-082-783; 045-652-639-050-09X; 045-727-315-816-400; 045-882-374-185-434; 046-161-370-694-828; 046-546-261-984-022; 050-338-421-825-767; 050-359-510-075-390; 050-733-201-179-820; 050-771-648-474-946; 051-222-185-269-499; 054-137-052-273-702; 054-346-861-480-171; 055-546-449-927-747; 056-119-760-163-073; 056-234-014-371-325; 057-155-775-487-665; 060-764-977-996-902; 061-590-737-934-816; 062-345-734-180-577; 063-884-956-655-071; 064-505-210-292-394; 064-894-158-907-401; 065-495-657-781-039; 068-441-421-100-677; 068-515-521-391-829; 069-039-667-238-749; 069-858-791-370-631; 070-850-804-423-94X; 072-158-174-236-964; 073-383-759-488-486; 074-715-254-149-811; 075-423-262-210-303; 077-172-676-875-355; 078-191-692-654-19X; 079-695-200-513-119; 080-041-073-650-462; 081-845-257-719-268; 082-048-222-682-99X; 082-775-612-423-193; 083-466-748-706-448; 083-624-790-977-795; 084-000-404-241-132; 084-438-066-147-309; 084-655-668-683-695; 085-167-667-793-079; 085-479-896-729-217; 086-865-875-082-532; 089-343-626-989-265; 090-067-808-384-520; 092-413-661-814-355; 093-960-624-985-517; 094-366-245-872-605; 094-390-302-010-121; 094-591-595-894-020; 096-419-002-823-437; 098-291-528-283-87X; 102-760-412-846-150; 103-960-167-114-716; 105-517-468-324-211; 105-906-488-343-232; 106-132-494-267-782; 107-635-178-897-02X; 109-395-088-451-422; 110-342-528-430-155; 111-190-104-927-607; 115-644-793-432-472; 125-366-044-907-114; 125-684-388-754-944; 142-545-872-713-358; 145-836-260-411-753; 152-859-867-977-767; 152-995-834-317-240; 153-758-938-083-917; 159-402-741-692-04X; 174-639-896-582-362; 179-241-613-333-342; 187-934-772-351-953; 198-642-787-729-351,41

Low-molecular-weight phenolic resol is used as carbon-yielding component and triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 as pore-forming component. The morphology of nanoparticles could be tuned by well controlling the concentration of F127. The results show that rod-shaped and worm-like mesoporous carbon nanoparticles can be obtained when the concentration of F127 is set at ∼12 wt.% and 9 wt.%, respectively. The spherical nanoparticles are obtained when the concentration is reduced to 6 wt.%, and their size can be adjusted by further decreasing the F127 concentration. Moreover, the highly ordered mesostructure can be readily turned from 2D hexagonal (p6m) to 3D caged cubic (Im3¯m) along with the tuning of morphologies from rod-shaped to spherical. The as-obtained MCNs exhibit large surface area (∼1385 m2/g), high pore volume (∼0.919 cm3/g), highly ordered mesostructure, and continuous electron transport framework. Hence, the obtained mesoporous carbon materials show excellent capacitance (∼142 F/g at loading current density of 0.5 A/g) in the application of supercapacitors.",377,1.0,169.0,175.0,Poloxamer; Morphology (linguistics); Nanoparticle; Hydrothermal circulation; Copolymer; Nanotechnology; Materials science; Current density; Self-assembly; Chemical engineering; Supercapacitor,,Carbon/chemistry; Microspheres; Molecular Weight; Nanoparticles/chemistry; Particle Size; Phenols/chemistry; Poloxamer/chemistry; Porosity; Surface Properties,Phenols; Poloxamer; Carbon,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22542324 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012JCIS..377..169L/abstract https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22542324 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meng_Li50/publication/224866111_Ordered_mesoporous_carbon_nanoparticles_with_well-controlled_morphologies_from_sphere_to_rod_via_a_soft-template_route/links/5402939f0cf23d9765a52bc5.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979712003943,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.03.085,22542324.0,10.1016/j.jcis.2012.03.085,1989091924,,0,002-925-300-563-065; 005-373-854-541-120; 006-944-620-470-692; 007-453-260-009-586; 007-632-437-623-105; 010-168-977-274-884; 012-286-912-552-214; 013-474-826-153-940; 020-383-196-254-666; 021-030-039-297-470; 021-547-396-558-829; 023-984-448-649-000; 024-162-583-406-339; 025-652-759-933-991; 027-239-015-443-440; 027-705-488-967-362; 033-920-035-339-346; 037-610-821-540-276; 040-232-100-174-82X; 043-458-647-484-03X; 047-985-262-810-754; 056-388-144-650-623; 058-128-570-816-19X; 059-090-608-875-263; 068-811-029-815-155; 071-363-093-237-531; 073-877-671-573-811; 077-996-437-608-104; 079-098-713-912-830; 082-032-321-772-10X; 082-133-062-635-495; 090-636-552-478-474; 107-931-345-350-694; 109-711-187-294-196; 116-957-216-077-232; 117-773-514-816-101; 143-120-419-025-891; 152-134-060-739-989,65

Vinci; Luis A. Colón,"A sample containing carbon nanoparticles was obtained starting with the soot generated during combustion of inexpensive paraffin oil in a flame. The complexity of the sample, however, required fractionation to isolate its components. Anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (AE-HPLC) was used for the analysis and collection of soot-derived carbon nanoparticles. The fractionated species were monitored by ultraviolet (UV) absorption and laser-induced photoluminescence detection, providing the chromatographic UV absorption and emission profiles of the separated sample. Chromatographic fractionation allowed for bulk measurements of electronic properties for individual fractions and further analysis via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM of fractionated species showed a predominant size of about 4–5 nm diameter particulates.

In voltammetric measurements strong pH effects on capacitance and Faradaic current responses are observed due to chitosan forming a shell (or “hydrothermal wrapping”) around both carbon nanoparticles and palladium particles in the water-based hydrothermal process. In spite of the wrapping, some Pd-catalytic processes are observed, but with pH controlling the rate. The shell around Pd nanoparticles appears to only allow small molecule reactants such as H 2 and O 2 but not formic acid or methanol to reach the active catalyst surface. Membrane-transport limited and reaction-type limited catalytic electrochemical responses are observed with high selectivity. Implications of small molecule selectivity and mechanistic selectivity in suppressing cross-over losses in fuel cell technology are discussed.",110,,663.0,669.0,Selectivity; Hydrothermal circulation; Catalysis; Inorganic chemistry; Chemistry; Hydrothermal synthesis; Formic acid; Methanol; Palladium; Electrochemistry,,,,CSC,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468613000339 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468613000339 https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/imparting-ph-and-small-molecule-selectivity-to-nano-pd-catalysts-,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2013.01.014,,10.1016/j.electacta.2013.01.014,2076837041,,0,001-895-179-303-585; 007-730-423-429-415; 014-726-599-748-040; 018-466-133-971-897; 028-135-049-507-764; 032-255-757-931-380; 045-546-306-847-907; 047-652-404-703-204; 055-965-101-736-823; 062-385-579-611-846; 065-151-245-771-88X; 065-298-467-829-844; 071-972-324-170-703; 083-205-087-296-561; 118-876-619-169-017; 122-108-474-183-821; 127-581-870-949-37X; 130-286-916-569-37X; 199-726-156-573-877,5

To investigate the potential use of indirect computed tomography lymphography (CT-LG) with dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DENPs) in the localization and enhanced imaging of cervical sentinel lymph node (SLN) on rabbit model. Methods. Twelve rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: the positive control group and the experimental group. In the control group, indirect CT-LG was performed with the injection of 0.5 ml activated carbon nanoparticles (ACNP) and Omnipaque mixture suspension in the right tongue submucosa. CT images were acquired before the injection and 1, 5, 10, and 15 min after the injection, respectively. In the experimental group, indirect CT-LG injection with 0.5 ml Au DENPs suspension was performed in the right tongue submucosa. CT images were obtained before the injection and 1, 5, 10, and 15 min and 1, 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after the injection, respectively. Then, SLN identification and enhancement characteristics were evaluated. Results. Indirect CT-LG revealed the enhancement of one right deep cervical lymph nodes in all animals, which was SLN. SLN location was marked with black color (ACNP dye) or purple-black color (Au DENPs dye). At each detection time point, the enhanced SLN attenuation values of control rabbits were statistically significantly higher than that of the plain scan, respectively ( ). Also the values of experimental rabbits were statistically significantly higher than that of the control at the same time point after injection ( ). The detection rate of SLN was 100%. Conclusions. Indirect CT-LG with injection of Au DENPs as CT contrast agents can locate the SLN for a long period of time and enrich the SLN black dye. It is helpful for SLNs identification during the operation.",2018,,1230151.0,1230151.0,Colloidal gold; Tomography; Chemistry; Deep cervical lymph nodes; Submucosa; Sentinel lymph node; Nuclear medicine; Positive control; Rabbit model; Dendrimer,,"Animals; Contrast Media/chemistry; Dendrimers/chemistry; Gold/chemistry; Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry; Models, Animal; Rabbits; Sentinel Lymph Node/diagnostic imaging; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Contrast Media; Dendrimers; Gold,Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/1230151.pdf http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/1230151.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5932527 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29850482/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29850482 https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/1230151/ https://core.ac.uk/display/156970961,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/1230151,29850482.0,10.1155/2018/1230151,2801884907,PMC5932527,0,003-600-577-132-269; 011-751-285-341-77X; 012-219-769-834-920; 013-766-438-077-880; 014-449-761-720-597; 018-129-522-456-429; 023-535-293-743-073; 024-500-173-187-267; 026-288-774-541-636; 028-744-612-640-008; 035-076-203-158-475; 036-833-300-780-102; 037-024-592-487-43X; 038-416-629-500-802; 039-659-190-909-574; 050-524-702-064-086; 051-405-042-488-127; 054-553-147-394-50X; 058-905-850-947-69X; 060-846-896-654-096; 065-631-685-506-804; 068-814-506-152-483; 071-247-082-089-184; 074-286-723-315-745; 078-245-391-936-098; 080-742-861-858-944; 083-769-513-519-857; 098-082-072-627-273; 100-722-076-625-964; 100-732-836-811-962; 105-763-004-636-974; 106-652-225-641-667; 108-714-024-869-976; 112-766-603-076-814; 114-183-343-241-681; 130-007-828-717-868; 134-090-565-184-11X; 159-569-106-411-258,4
000-123-570-548-829,Reversible and simultaneous control of conduction and magnetism in organic materials by UV irradiation,,2013,journal article,Journal of Material Science & Engineering,21690022,OMICS Publishing Group,,Toshio Naito,"W have developed molecular non-magnetic insulators which reversibly exhibits metallic properties with localized spins under light irradiation. Such materials can be applied to electromagnetic switches and sensors controlled by light. Such devices are advantageous over existing ones in terms of low energy consumptions and having both function of memory (magnetism) and calculation (conduction). Our strategy is exciting many CT transitions at a time by white light, causing a large amount of electron transfer between photochemical redox pairs. Since the radical anions of Ni(dmit)2 complex molecule, to which we pay particular attention, often produce Mott insulators, this strategy may correspond to “optical doping” to Mott insulators. Doping to Mott insulators is known for often leading to high-TC superconductors and other unusual physical properties demonstrated by cuprates and fullerides. For example, the methyl viologen (MV) salt, MV[Ni(dmit)2]2, exhibits higher conductivity under UV irradiation than that under dark by three orders of magnitude, and also exhibits metallic behavior under UV irradiation down to low temperature. The irradiation of vis-NIR light, which is intensely absorbed by the Ni(dmit)2 radical monoanions, does not lead to such high (photo)conductivity. This may be because the photoconductivity of standard mechanism produces carriers in the Ni(dmit)2 bands at the cost of charge disproportionation, while our CT-based photoconductivity can produce more carriers without such charge disproportionation. By clarifying the mechanism as well as synthesizing related compounds, we can make further steps towards new compounds with better performance, which will be applied to practical use in the future advanced information technology.
