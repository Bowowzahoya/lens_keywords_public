000-012-732-991-582,Correlation of electron self-energy with geometric structure in low-energy electron diffraction.,2011-11-29,2011,journal article,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,1361648x; 09538984,IOP Publishing Ltd.,United Kingdom,J. Vuorinen; Katariina Pussi; Renee D. Diehl; Matti Lindroos,"In low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) studies of surface geometries where the energy dependence of the intensities is analyzed, the in-plane lattice parameter of the surface is usually set to a value determined by x-ray diffraction for the bulk crystal. In cases where it is not known, for instance in films that are incommensurate with the substrate, it is desirable to fit the in-plane lattice parameters in the same analysis as the perpendicular interlayer spacings. We show that this is not possible in a conventional LEED I(E) analysis because the inner potential, which is typically treated as an adjustable parameter, is correlated with the geometrical structure. Therefore, without having prior knowledge of the inner potential, it is not possible to determine the complete surface structure simply from LEED I(E) spectra, and the in-plane lattice parameter must be determined independently before the I(E) analysis is performed. This can be accomplished by establishing a more precise experimental geometry. Further, it is shown that the convention of omitting the energy dependency of the real part of the inner potential means geometrical LEED results cannot be trusted beyond a precision of approximately 0.01 A.",24,1.0,015003,015003,Low-energy electron diffraction; Optics; Lattice constant; Lattice (order); Materials science; Reflection high-energy electron diffraction; Diffraction; Gas electron diffraction; Molecular physics; Self-energy; Electron diffraction,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22127050 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22127050 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/24/1/015003/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/24/1/015003,22127050.0,10.1088/0953-8984/24/1/015003,2086975122.0,,0,000-188-283-475-759; 003-129-559-785-934; 014-296-895-654-367; 014-586-277-114-844; 026-856-639-721-995; 052-348-177-020-431; 052-828-697-494-481; 063-134-263-513-000; 066-432-154-239-158; 073-395-519-792-268; 084-375-314-665-645; 097-954-884-648-618; 101-426-936-789-37X; 102-787-207-853-079; 112-817-791-790-19X; 128-111-274-145-607; 152-390-156-603-480; 169-177-889-592-832; 175-918-721-859-292; 185-885-671-992-304; 186-851-260-012-130,3

After patterning further electrodes on-top of the tube electronic transport measurements showed room temperature conductances of up to 0.2 G0.

Due to the relatively large energy bandgap, Bi2Se3 has been identified as one of the most promising three-dimensional TIs with application potentials. Epitaxial Bi2Se3 by molecular-beam epitaxy has been reported by many groups using different substrates. A common feature is that Bi2Se3 grows readily along the c-axis direction irrespective of the type and condition of the substrate. Because of the weak van deer Waals interaction between Bi2Se3 quintuple layers, the grown films are reported to be strain-free, taking the lattice constant of the bulk crystal. At the very initial stage of Bi2Se3 deposition, however, strain may still exist depending on the substrate. Strain may bring some drastic effects to the properties of the TIs and so achieving strained TIs can be of great fundamental interests as well as practical relevance. In this work, we employ reflection high-energy electron diffraction to follow the lattice constant evolution of Bi2Se3 during initial stage depositions on GaN and graphene, two very different substrates. We reveal that epitaxial Bi2Se3 is tensile strained on GaN but strain-free on graphene.

Lábár; Partha P. Das,"Diffuse rings from amorphous materials sit on a steep background resulting in a monotonically decreasing intensity over scattering vector length, frequently with no clear local maximum that could be used to determine the center of the ring. The novelty of the method reported here is that it successful processes such weak patterns. It is based on separating the angular dependence of the positions of the maxima on the azimuthal angle in the measured two-dimensional pattern for a manually preselected peak. Both pattern center and elliptical distortion are simultaneously refined from this angular dependence. Both steps are based on nonlinear least square fitting, using the Levenberg–Marquardt method. It can be successfully applied to any amorphous patterns provided they were recorded with experimental conditions that facilitate dividing them into sectors with acceptable statistics. Patterns with the center shifted to the camera corner (recording a quadrant of a ring) can also be reliably evaluated, keeping precalibrated values of the elliptical distortion fixed during the fit. Finally, the limited number of counts in any pattern is overcome by cumulating many patterns (from equivalent areas) into a single pattern. Eliminating false effects is facilitated by masking out unwanted parts of any recorded pattern from processing.",23,3.0,647,660,Distortion; Optics; Masking (art); Azimuth; Scattering; Materials science; Amorphous solid; Electron diffraction; Maxima; Intensity (physics),TEM; amorphous materials; computer program; partial patterns; thin films,,,,http://real.mtak.hu/54107/ https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/pattern-center-and-distortion-determined-from-faint-diffuse-electron-diffraction-rings-from-amorphous-materials/AACFF54971CE382A3EBF1D51C5749A3D https://core.ac.uk/display/83552182 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28434432 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MiMic..23..647L/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1431927617000435,28434432.0,10.1017/s1431927617000435,2609068546.0,,0,001-646-452-094-036; 002-079-666-111-661; 002-398-956-847-43X; 009-444-031-523-424; 015-068-322-940-085; 015-417-189-877-496; 017-906-111-400-241; 031-275-674-448-571; 031-418-171-870-805; 032-426-216-667-154; 036-026-037-979-85X; 045-850-596-580-599; 047-877-270-698-450; 061-349-088-100-06X; 075-579-208-166-197; 082-178-291-467-148; 087-108-326-306-415; 089-604-124-103-017; 091-334-845-436-166; 096-628-913-223-775; 163-912-204-160-990; 165-175-091-597-509,3

It has been shown by atomic force microscopy that at selected growth conditions stand-alone faceted Co nanoparticles are formed on a fluorite surface. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) studies have revealed that the particles crystallize in the face-centered cubic lattice structure otherwise non-achievable in bulk cobalt under normal conditions. The particles were found to inherit lattice orientation from the underlying CaF2 layer. Three-dimensional reciprocal space mapping carried out using X-ray and electron diffraction has revealed that there exist long bright 〈111〉 streaks passing through the cobalt Bragg reflections. These streaks are attributed to stacking faults formed in the crystal lattice of larger islands upon coalescence of independently nucleated smaller islands. Distinguished from the stacking fault streaks, crystal truncation rods perpendicular to the {111} and {001} particle facets have been observed. Finally, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) has been applied to decouple the shape-related scattering from that induced by the crystal lattice defects. Particle faceting has been verified by modeling the GISAXS patterns.

Crystallite sizes were determined by XRD analysis as 72 nm, which was quite similar to the 70 nm as measured by SEM. The shell comprised aggregates of hexagonal plates of aragonite (500 nm wide, 70 nm high) and organic matter. These plates were fourth-order units of an aragonitic crossed order lamellar structure. Subsequent TEM images showed the hexagonal plates’ nanostructure. The electron diffraction pattern of the fourth-order units revealed a consistent orientation of the hexagonal plates. The fourth-order lamellae (hexagonal crystallites) were piled up in the [0 0 1] direction to produce slender prisms (third-order lamellae), arranged mutually parallel, thereby forming a broad tablet (second-order lamellae). The second-order lamellae were piled up in different directions to form the first-order lamellae. The orientation level obtained from XRD and SEM images showed that the crossed lamellar layer was piled up curvilinearly, forming semi-circular growth lines. X-ray diffraction patterns of the cross-sections of the middle layer (vertical and parallel to the growth line) showed that the c axes of aragonite have a disposition of about 20° to the growth direction.",113,2.0,125,130,Crystallite; Transmission electron microscopy; Nanostructure; Mineralogy; Diffraction; Scanning electron microscope; Shell (structure); Lamellar structure; Crystallography; Biology; Microstructure,,"Animals; Calcium Carbonate/analysis; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Snails/ultrastructure; X-Ray Diffraction",Calcium Carbonate,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20346639 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944200610000206,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2009.08.004,20346639.0,10.1016/j.zool.2009.08.004,1994095792.0,,0,016-143-027-525-595; 016-436-476-713-291; 028-869-180-733-559; 034-902-862-226-780; 037-351-306-196-593; 038-845-168-503-255; 040-548-115-486-771; 049-629-882-062-71X; 049-971-606-381-099; 064-325-741-033-043; 079-214-911-982-528; 091-809-734-038-217; 093-383-900-325-877; 094-885-329-739-443; 097-307-395-440-620; 104-366-103-854-840; 113-459-601-862-252; 123-844-550-251-26X; 129-382-664-866-590; 134-262-962-320-478; 151-815-291-871-52X,15

A. Haque; Ramakrishnan Rajagopalan; Henry C. Foley,"The amorphous to crystalline phase transformation process is typically known to take place at very high temperatures and facilitated by very high compressive stresses. In this study, we demonstrate crystallization of amorphous ultra-thin platinum films at room temperature under tensile stresses. Using a micro-electro-mechanical device, we applied up to 3% uniaxial tensile strain in 3-5 nm thick focused ion beam deposited platinum films supported by another 3-5 nm thick amorphous carbon film. The experiments were performed in situ inside a transmission electron microscope to acquire the bright field and selected area diffraction patterns. The platinum films were observed to crystallize irreversibly from an amorphous phase to face-centered cubic nanocrystals with average grain size of about 10 nm. Measurement of crystal spacing from electron diffraction patterns confirms large tensile residual stress in the platinum specimens. We propose that addition of the externally applied stress provides the activation energy needed to nucleate crystallization, while subsequent grain growth takes place through enhanced atomic and vacancy diffusion as an energetically favorable route towards stress relaxation at the nanoscale.",21,50.0,505707,505707,Nanocrystalline material; Composite material; Materials science; Amorphous carbon; Stress relaxation; Crystallization; Selected area diffraction; Residual stress; Amorphous solid; Electron diffraction; Crystallography,,,,,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21098951 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/room-temperature-amorphous-to-nanocrystalline-transformation-in-u https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/21/50/505707 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21098951 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/21/50/505707/pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21098951/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Nanot..21X5707P/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0957-4484/21/50/505707,21098951.0,10.1088/0957-4484/21/50/505707,2091018294.0,,0,001-785-548-225-440; 002-264-838-251-05X; 002-503-726-626-81X; 005-179-541-517-964; 005-373-375-916-167; 005-607-704-562-144; 005-804-674-956-718; 005-847-125-330-747; 007-017-819-360-377; 007-052-768-496-082; 011-405-413-929-569; 012-578-899-167-104; 015-137-003-084-775; 016-279-705-763-836; 018-581-199-608-007; 019-502-215-224-475; 019-511-378-525-824; 020-055-013-488-61X; 020-863-650-414-694; 023-142-070-877-827; 025-949-859-834-613; 028-900-980-550-884; 029-967-811-037-249; 030-880-864-974-563; 033-404-962-818-427; 033-598-049-577-318; 039-165-535-441-461; 039-410-706-582-792; 041-276-822-677-518; 041-756-091-441-810; 043-781-278-069-040; 044-290-396-548-616; 047-024-642-201-288; 049-558-559-380-915; 054-412-051-537-896; 055-109-717-346-661; 058-692-784-455-219; 059-068-131-584-07X; 060-100-487-548-451; 060-137-185-408-161; 060-889-683-861-198; 062-725-000-190-260; 063-571-387-500-75X; 065-356-309-955-514; 070-231-527-699-864; 070-476-744-966-821; 073-460-650-775-429; 075-069-469-571-019; 081-900-207-443-362; 083-766-026-740-905; 088-999-116-745-469; 090-060-823-845-231; 093-456-884-874-992; 102-763-357-016-763; 109-365-092-175-777; 114-078-487-598-116; 116-452-707-432-549; 117-882-567-573-978; 119-769-291-196-734; 121-265-528-430-449; 123-167-618-219-448; 129-732-928-828-369; 130-911-323-501-303; 136-434-936-443-387; 137-247-748-262-207; 143-560-827-344-970; 143-591-972-629-616; 148-093-904-531-836; 155-886-780-228-440; 157-065-048-115-706; 160-009-830-770-69X; 168-364-196-336-729; 172-409-037-612-942; 173-752-053-585-125,10

X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the as-grown film contained highly crystalline zinc hydroxystannate. When it was annealed at 300 °C, zinc hydroxystannate was decomposed, and wurtzite-structured ZnO was formed. High-resolution TEM images and selected electron diffraction patterns further confirmed the formation of wurtzite-structured ZnO after annealing. The scanning electron microscope observed that the as-grown Zn-Sn-(OH)x film contained two layers: the upper layer was a crystalline ZnSn(OH)6 thin film, and the underlying layer was an amorphous Zn-Sn-O ternary composite. After it was annealed at 300 °C, some pyramid-like nanostructures appeared on the film surface. As the annealing temperature was further increased, the areal density of the pyramid-shaped nanostructures decreased, but the diameter and height increased. The photoluminescence spectra showed that the ZnSn(OH)6 film exhibited strong violet and blue-green co-emission. After annealing, the visible emission intensity was obviously reduced, while an ultraviolet emission from ZnO was being appeared. We proposed that the violet emission of ZnSn(OH)6 thin film might be related to the zinc interstitials, and the blue-green emission should come from the electronic transitions related to oxygen vacancy levels.",109,,110312,,Analytical chemistry; Luminescence; Thin film; Materials science; Scanning electron microscope; Zinc; Amorphous solid; Annealing (metallurgy); Electron diffraction; Photoluminescence,,,,Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China; Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925346720306534,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.optmat.2020.110312,,10.1016/j.optmat.2020.110312,3084403483.0,,0,002-304-770-380-448; 002-357-805-180-905; 003-633-530-970-944; 004-360-655-905-578; 010-232-784-978-192; 010-508-605-768-013; 010-681-657-117-174; 011-516-001-505-788; 014-255-568-240-748; 014-290-891-501-104; 015-322-236-585-030; 033-755-028-431-770; 037-662-786-568-330; 044-073-914-576-158; 044-319-595-624-606; 044-461-133-116-268; 053-024-614-398-05X; 054-832-072-790-349; 055-336-093-660-301; 061-965-774-922-361; 068-386-127-004-570; 073-761-443-267-746; 082-589-010-588-338; 094-281-488-634-035; 096-397-664-615-720; 099-611-182-861-957; 101-250-477-798-798; 111-909-490-434-986; 129-003-389-001-433; 137-830-547-533-224; 142-061-032-358-911; 157-880-764-322-547; 161-714-774-900-241; 172-176-456-690-545; 175-855-897-779-995,0

Negatively charged –SO3− could act as a linker between Ag+ ions (Ag nanoparticles) and polystyrene beads. The positively charged PS beads were also prepared by a grafting method, and silver nanoparticles deposition on positively charged and uncharged PS beads were also studied. The Ag nanoparticles were coated on the poly(styrene-co-sulfonic acid) beads via an in situ reduction method. The morphologies of the synthesis samples were investigated by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), (high resolution) transmission electron microscopy (TEM, HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). The results indicated that the reducing agent and electric charge had an important influence on the deposition of silver nanoparticles. As a potential application, the Ag/PS hybrid materials were embedded with the reporter molecule methylene blue (MB), and the signal intensity of the SERS (surface-enhanced Raman scattering) tags could be enormously increased. So, the Ag/PS hybrid SERS tags can provide unique signal averaging for potentially quantitative analysis, which were used for SERS substrate design and SERS bioassays analysis. The facile and green chemistry preparation method might also provide a development direction to fabricate different nanometal/PS composites by the simple procedure.",3,33.0,13740,13747,Analytical chemistry; Transmission electron microscopy; High-resolution transmission electron microscopy; Reducing agent; Materials science; Hybrid material; Selected area diffraction; Polystyrene; Sulfonic acid; Silver nanoparticle; Chemical engineering,,,,,http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c3ra40888d https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ra/c3ra40888d http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/RA/C3RA40888D#!divAbstract https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6644821,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra40888d,,10.1039/c3ra40888d,2043886973.0,,0,000-727-656-763-105; 001-400-927-007-611; 003-066-739-253-171; 005-283-107-895-540; 006-027-539-711-534; 007-908-130-559-676; 010-150-906-098-769; 016-461-463-890-381; 021-534-026-931-291; 022-608-246-044-278; 025-525-014-716-00X; 025-794-940-319-316; 026-747-722-456-886; 027-086-062-932-867; 030-998-739-005-37X; 032-108-254-224-73X; 036-620-022-164-81X; 043-301-723-236-340; 046-746-248-859-776; 056-520-026-540-736; 057-212-935-913-546; 057-846-130-451-174; 058-458-225-553-722; 059-263-848-297-637; 061-968-346-253-273; 063-720-765-659-765; 067-128-399-664-152; 067-455-389-906-005; 071-003-067-943-257; 072-112-436-915-091; 072-292-617-923-614; 079-756-913-358-186; 081-306-021-534-424; 085-188-395-116-703; 087-646-811-906-13X; 094-461-116-360-270; 094-914-474-851-108; 095-607-715-190-117; 095-949-099-174-18X; 096-443-712-554-593; 100-992-598-392-782; 102-191-858-399-757; 119-780-586-391-112; 150-459-896-991-773; 151-999-216-338-281; 184-274-088-020-656,23

Even with these limitations, they are subject of interest because of high optical and device efficiency. In this work, we propose a modified growth strategy in which monolayer (ML) deposition of QDs is varied based on reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) pattern to achieve defect free structure with uniform dot size distribution. The overgrowth percentage, i.e. monolayer deposition above critical thickness (minimum thickness required for transition from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) confined structures) was kept constant in modified strategy. To verify this claim, we have compared it with conventional strain coupled multilayer structure and demonstrated improved optical performance and device characteristics. Photoluminescence spectroscopy exhibited monomodal QD distribution in strain-coupled multi-stacked heterostructure grown by the proposed strategy. Power dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurement confirms existence of single ground state peak. The proposed strategy yielded a defect free structure and better carrier capture rate compared to conventional multilayer QDs. The spectral response observed from proposed quantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) exhibited multiple peaks in mid-IR region (3.92 µm and 4.54 µm), which is one of the essential requirements for fabricating infrared detectors or focal plane arrays. Post-growth thermal annealing treatment at various temperatures (650–800 °C) were performed to verify the change in activation energy, ground-state emission peak, and thermal stability. Negligible change in the ground-state PL emission peak (",192,,562,566,Analytical chemistry; Quantum dot; Materials science; Reflection high-energy electron diffraction; Photodetector; Spectroscopy; Optoelectronics; Monolayer; Electron diffraction; Heterojunction; Photoluminescence,,,,SERB-DST; Indian Space Research Organization,https://research.vit.ac.in/publication/evidence-of-quantum-dot-size-uniformity-in-strain-coupled http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022231316312522 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022231316312522,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jlumin.2017.07.035,,10.1016/j.jlumin.2017.07.035,2738284022.0,,0,002-234-801-517-929; 012-029-542-683-980; 024-552-667-082-275; 028-722-824-019-128; 034-071-076-121-477; 040-563-836-605-65X; 044-972-449-377-08X; 075-528-124-515-791; 075-557-016-432-457; 083-970-617-962-700; 105-718-583-000-790; 112-596-701-380-407; 112-599-683-982-300; 120-581-909-921-282; 133-697-958-350-945; 142-851-969-941-678; 163-854-855-952-294; 180-509-779-849-12X; 181-480-567-611-048,12

We use potential energy maps to visualize our concept and to derive a relation that allows anticipating epitaxial growth from low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) data.

B. Ullah; Mykyta Toporkov; Vitaliy Avrutin; Ümit Özgür; David J. Smith; Hadis Morkoç,"We investigated the crystal structure, growth kinetics and electrical properties of BeMgZnO/ZnO heterostructures grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies revealed that incorporation of Mg into the BeZnO solid solution eliminates the high angle grain boundaries that are the major structural defects in ternary BeZnO. The significant improvement of x-ray diffraction intensity from quaternary BeMgZnO alloy compared to ternary BeZnO was attributed to the reduction of lattice strain, which is present in the latter due to the large difference of covalent radii between Be and Zn (1.22 A for Zn, 0.96 A for Be). Incorporation of Mg, which has a larger covalent radius of 1.41A, reduced the strain in BeMgZnO thin films and also enhanced Be incorporation on lattice sites in the wurtzite lattice. The Zn/(Be + Mg) ratio necessary to obtain single-crystal O-polar BeMgZnO on (0001) GaN/sapphire templates was found to increase with increasing substrate temperature:3.9, 6.2, and 8.3 at substrate temperatures of 450°C, 475°C, and 500°C, respectively. Based on analysis of photoluminescence spectra from Be0.03MgyZn0.97-yO and evolution of reflection high-energy electron diffraction patterns observed in situ during the MBE growth, it has been deduced that more negative formation enthalpy of MgO compared to ZnO and the increased surface mobility of Mg adatoms at elevated substrate temperatures give rise to the nucleation of a MgO-rich wurtzite phase at relatively low Zn/(Be + Mg) ratios. We have demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the incorporation of Be into the barrier in Zn-polar BeMgZnO/ZnO and O-polar ZnO/BeMgZnO polarization doped heterostructures allows the alignment of piezoelectric polarization vector with that of spontaneous polarization due to the change of strain sign, thus increasing the amount of net polarization. This made it possible to achieve Zn-polar BeMgZnO/ZnO heterostructures grown on GaN/sapphire templates with two-dimensional electron gas densities substantially exceeding those in Zn-polar MgZnO/ZnO and O-polar ZnO/MgZnO heterostructures with similar Mg content.",10105,,,,Analytical chemistry; Covalent radius; Transmission electron microscopy; Thin film; Materials science; Gallium nitride; Wurtzite crystal structure; Molecular beam epitaxy; Grain boundary; Electron diffraction,,,,,https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/quaternary-bemgzno-by-plasma-enhanced-molecular-beam-epitaxy-for- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017SPIE10105E..0JU/abstract https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10105/101050J/Quaternary-BeMgZnO-by-plasma-enhanced-molecular-beam-epitaxy-for-BeMgZnO/10.1117/12.2260814.full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2260814,,10.1117/12.2260814,2591800005.0,,0,000-604-230-538-760; 002-424-149-693-776; 003-266-738-420-771; 005-079-262-106-718; 006-768-807-896-706; 008-882-158-681-984; 015-048-192-768-732; 019-660-996-164-121; 029-620-292-203-74X; 034-602-179-015-159; 038-514-009-515-236; 045-655-706-908-468; 045-937-826-329-984; 049-762-820-083-69X; 057-800-403-119-588; 060-684-870-925-557; 061-619-670-909-574; 066-889-717-243-987; 068-266-298-383-740; 069-137-589-303-574; 070-678-939-479-869; 072-707-293-734-13X; 073-088-146-582-849; 073-554-796-900-285; 074-603-247-826-910; 100-976-200-238-356; 113-621-124-911-594; 121-915-515-079-065; 129-468-144-833-872; 139-447-811-661-817; 141-891-815-355-801; 147-842-593-719-709; 150-536-991-149-53X,1

However, the problem of high dislocation density in HgCdTe layers grown on these lattice-mismatched substrates has yet to be resolved. In this work, we investigated another alternative substrate, GaSb, which has a significantly smaller lattice mismatch with HgCdTe in comparison with Si, Ge, and GaAs, and is readily available as large-area, epiready wafers at much lower cost in comparison with lattice-matched CdZnTe substrates. The resultant stress due to lattice and thermal mismatch between the HgCdTe epilayer and various substrates has been calculated in this work using the elasticity matrix, and the corresponding stress distribution simulated using ANSYS. The simulated structures were matched by experimental samples involving MBE growth of HgCdTe on GaAs, GaSb, and CdZnTe substrates, and were characterized via reflection high-energy electron diffraction and x-ray diffraction analysis, followed by etch pit density (EPD) analysis. In comparison with other alternative substrates, GaSb is shown to have lower interface stress and lower EPD, rendering it an interesting and promising alternative substrate material for HgCdTe epitaxy.",45,9.0,4596,4602,Epitaxy; Elasticity (economics); Infrared; Wafer; Materials science; Diffraction; Solid-state physics; Optoelectronics; Electron diffraction; Etch pit density,,,,,https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/investigation-of-substrate-effects-on-interface-strain-and-defect https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016JEMat..45.4596G/abstract https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11664-016-4558-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11664-016-4558-6,,10.1007/s11664-016-4558-6,2403052281.0,,0,005-988-508-840-532; 008-503-726-826-481; 015-854-300-964-412; 021-477-013-794-648; 023-934-649-186-932; 024-445-422-573-056; 025-004-012-188-377; 027-852-240-032-870; 042-320-156-382-540; 046-321-695-718-015; 052-156-624-260-087; 058-613-183-713-245; 058-805-266-243-492; 061-215-309-507-59X; 090-215-902-927-634; 093-468-365-564-421; 106-537-931-283-728; 107-127-131-620-049; 111-033-290-323-68X; 121-864-537-213-758; 124-081-840-909-596; 136-190-176-154-284; 144-349-932-777-084; 152-146-435-919-950; 161-681-937-325-643; 164-375-310-119-241; 198-782-896-177-714,4

Cheng; L.H. Chang; C.F. Chuang; H. Chen,"Abstract In this study, we report on the fabrication and characterization of periodic Ni and Ni-silicide nanocontact arrays on (1 1 0)Si substrates. From transmission electron microscopy and selected-area electron diffraction analysis, it is found that the epitaxial NiSi 2 is the first and the only silicide phase formed in the nanoscale Ni contact/(1 1 0)Si sample after annealing at a temperature as low as 300 °C, demonstrating that the nanoscale Ni contact is more favorable for the epitaxial growth of NiSi 2 phase on (1 1 0)Si. The orientation relationship between the epitaxial NiSi 2 nanocontacts and the (1 1 0)Si substrate is identified as [1 1 0]NiSi 2 //[1 1 0]Si and ( 1 ¯ 1 1 ¯ )NiSi 2 //( 1 ¯ 1 1 ¯ )Si. For the samples annealed at higher temperatures, all the epitaxial NiSi 2 nanocontacts formed on (1 1 0)Si are anisotropic in shape and elongated along the crystallographic 1 1 ¯ 0 directions. The observed results can be attributed to the higher surface area to volume ratio of Ni nanocontacts and the faster growth rate along the 〈1 1 0〉 directions than along other directions. The size and periodicity of the nanocontacts can be readily controlled by adjusting the diameter of the colloidal nanosphere template. The self-assembled approach proposed here will provide the capability to fabricate other highly-ordered metal silicide nanocontact arrays and may offer potential applications in constructing silicide-based nanodevices.",343,,88,93,Epitaxy; Fabrication; Transmission electron microscopy; Nanotechnology; Materials science; Silicide; Nanosphere lithography; Nanoscopic scale; Optoelectronics; Annealing (metallurgy); Electron diffraction,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, ROC",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433215006352 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433215006352 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApSS..343...88C/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.03.058,,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.03.058,2004646098.0,,0,000-362-071-288-864; 002-994-281-210-641; 003-134-570-237-150; 005-822-681-865-805; 011-251-175-518-596; 016-821-790-980-954; 025-927-850-353-170; 026-144-332-146-417; 026-190-495-317-572; 026-260-672-294-123; 027-718-801-970-959; 030-165-406-164-173; 031-266-930-304-83X; 031-894-221-425-548; 046-438-489-514-475; 056-429-251-719-620; 069-609-554-622-420; 070-148-595-586-637; 071-945-088-130-609; 076-729-688-540-535; 088-162-806-737-146; 088-836-165-334-432; 093-406-360-788-22X; 104-528-766-616-295; 119-961-292-952-984; 122-745-292-689-129; 124-449-788-935-879; 131-517-938-389-275; 135-129-829-289-92X; 143-316-744-335-425,0

The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the phytochemical-mediated reduced reaction mixture showed a surface plasmon peak at 428 nm, which confirmed the presence of silver nanoparticles. The silver nanoparticle production was ideal at pH 9 with 2.0 mL jackfruit rind extract, Ag+ 1.0 mM and 180 min of reaction time. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated the presence of acids, esters, alcohols, pyrazine, etc. which can act as capping agents around the nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the face-centered cubic crystalline and the oxygen structure of metallic silver nanoparticles. The average diameter of silver nanoparticles is ~17 nm via high resolution transmission electron microscopy, which agrees with the average crystallite size (24.2 nm) calculated from X-ray diffraction analysis and selected area electron diffraction pattern.

The synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), specific surface area (BET), and porosity determination (BJH). The morphology and particle size was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). All prepared samples have a red-shifted band-gap transition, well crystalline anatase structure, and porous particles with a 100–200 m2 g−1 specific surface area. The photocatalytic activity of iodine-doped titania samples was determined by decomposition of Orange II dye during irradiation at 365 nm and 400 nm. Iodine doping promotes the titania photocatalytic activity very efficiently under visible light irradiation. The titania sample with 0.32 wt.% I has the highest catalytic activity during the photocatalyzed degradation of Orange II dye in an aqueous suspension in the UV and visible regions.",2011,,1,13,Visible spectrum; Specific surface area; Infrared spectroscopy; High-resolution transmission electron microscopy; Inorganic chemistry; Materials science; Selected area diffraction; Anatase; Raman spectroscopy; Photocatalysis,,,,Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic; Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2011/685935/reprint/ https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2011/685935.pdf https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2011/685935/ http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2011/685935.pdf https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/11621,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2011/685935,,10.1155/2011/685935,2152284328.0,,0,002-354-497-909-405; 002-362-600-377-92X; 002-835-728-105-066; 004-428-621-239-835; 004-777-970-801-270; 005-763-988-191-748; 009-665-195-037-712; 010-811-493-426-44X; 010-871-129-446-780; 013-219-650-636-667; 013-519-238-701-302; 014-702-127-997-464; 015-050-320-470-926; 016-013-576-204-035; 017-158-414-563-178; 018-884-935-199-693; 022-426-452-943-082; 023-617-808-749-546; 023-963-072-289-787; 024-516-314-037-315; 025-620-255-312-757; 026-897-155-353-058; 028-454-030-100-620; 031-928-209-442-700; 034-361-338-146-136; 035-185-028-109-248; 039-439-303-973-499; 039-727-564-622-247; 040-255-424-528-657; 041-176-093-300-885; 041-237-523-161-907; 041-508-060-265-786; 042-085-991-425-260; 044-019-860-994-68X; 045-494-315-338-897; 047-264-585-144-91X; 048-955-919-275-143; 050-378-987-055-497; 054-504-536-041-379; 055-687-795-259-621; 057-097-067-804-954; 064-759-687-038-764; 072-265-766-304-733; 073-227-155-335-572; 081-545-398-117-995; 084-459-864-251-832; 085-666-040-540-592; 086-241-508-257-729; 086-725-388-108-526; 088-495-664-998-871; 088-891-355-255-673; 095-908-581-960-073; 098-357-755-545-955; 098-750-589-017-436; 103-600-517-203-462; 104-567-216-814-053; 106-175-554-592-887; 108-032-060-184-431; 110-978-695-498-118; 111-273-186-552-493; 113-485-863-169-166; 132-455-528-227-412; 132-526-991-457-207; 133-228-972-209-954; 137-115-127-331-463; 139-442-679-411-50X; 144-621-504-868-975; 146-306-373-959-211; 147-750-583-001-519; 159-286-122-771-384; 160-673-263-524-497; 178-569-824-416-992,30

The experiments were performed under conditions of ultra-high vacuum. The thickness of silicon films was varied within the range of up to 1 nm, and the temperature of their annealing was 500°C. The characterization of the samples was carried out in situ by the methods of low-energy electron diffraction, high-energy-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation, and magnetic linear dichroism in photoemission of Co 3p electrons. New data were obtained on the evolution of the atomic and electronic structure, as well as on the magnetic properties of the system with an increase in the amount of intercalated silicon. It was shown that the intercalation under a graphene layer is accompanied by the synthesis of surface silicide Co2Si and a solid solution of silicon in cobalt.",58,10.0,2135,2140,Epitaxy; Analytical chemistry; Intercalation (chemistry); X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Materials science; Silicide; Graphene; Cobalt; Silicon; Electron diffraction,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhSS...58.2135G/abstract https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1063783416100164 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S1063783416100164.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/s1063783416100164,,10.1134/s1063783416100164,2535662319.0,,0,011-505-245-313-789; 011-618-813-634-638; 012-780-512-989-402; 013-983-499-961-662; 022-590-145-554-620; 025-215-392-144-324; 028-938-740-900-957; 031-434-038-268-778; 043-170-931-963-991; 048-966-196-844-851; 062-016-196-908-577; 081-193-184-358-025; 081-533-772-000-589; 085-456-018-407-490; 110-474-474-929-894; 120-219-330-294-417; 125-762-384-542-750; 131-962-348-658-477; 137-628-219-303-658; 137-944-147-601-385; 154-127-029-312-191; 190-235-750-550-260,3

However, their formation mechanisms associated with microbes in diffuse hydrothermal vents still remain largely unknown. The friable deposits, collected from the low-temperature diffuse flow at the Southern Atlantic Ridge, display a layered structure. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analyses reveal that abundant filamentous, spherical and rod-shaped mineralized forms are preserved in the yellowish-green layer of the deposits. These mineralized forms primarily consist of Si and Fe. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the mineralized forms indicate that they are composed of nontronite. High intensities of 12C and 12C14N signals derived from cellular structures determined by nano secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) suggest the intimate relationship between nontronite and microbes. The results of 454 pyrosequencing analyses provide insights into the microbial communities involved in the biologically-induced mineralization in the yellowish-green layer. We propose an evolutionary model for establishing paragenetic sequences among nontronite, Mn-oxide and Fe-oxyhydroxide in the deposits. This paragenetic sequence could be widespread in modern and ancient low-temperature hydrothermal fields.",122,9.0,2375,2392,Geology; Hydrothermal circulation; Mineralization (geology); Geochemistry; Biomineralization; Hydrothermal vent; Mineralogy; Scanning electron microscope; Selected area diffraction; Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Nontronite,,,,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Key Basic Research Program of China,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JG003852/full http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2017JG003852 http://ir.idsse.ac.cn/handle/183446/4768?mode=print https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2017JG003852 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017JGRG..122.2375T/abstract https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JG003852,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017jg003852,,10.1002/2017jg003852,2750158776.0,,0,000-143-183-188-534; 000-202-791-191-793; 000-730-347-549-153; 001-406-780-433-938; 001-992-182-904-212; 003-813-036-676-908; 004-225-499-819-958; 006-254-467-578-243; 007-171-947-733-41X; 007-501-978-442-083; 007-784-862-125-054; 008-076-418-940-123; 008-366-310-318-610; 008-624-120-985-075; 008-939-430-630-508; 009-632-700-589-948; 010-403-552-517-905; 013-454-893-625-911; 015-196-926-862-379; 015-666-534-019-909; 021-440-936-698-938; 022-186-179-999-084; 028-055-646-590-877; 031-098-603-401-173; 031-700-624-315-492; 032-530-819-159-167; 033-643-385-346-519; 034-988-383-317-597; 035-170-492-633-340; 037-680-036-503-502; 040-652-151-377-37X; 042-167-247-726-873; 043-319-855-650-565; 043-410-806-022-252; 043-783-003-008-563; 047-448-391-854-012; 049-519-906-689-908; 049-798-184-214-912; 049-871-209-004-101; 050-244-640-212-648; 050-973-078-817-227; 053-250-935-045-787; 054-443-854-308-597; 057-534-622-920-878; 059-700-328-483-025; 061-278-972-427-690; 062-031-933-928-478; 062-080-160-067-91X; 062-433-901-799-933; 062-605-715-822-800; 068-393-599-801-581; 068-504-419-270-277; 069-214-379-096-710; 071-166-899-669-621; 074-256-333-454-822; 075-135-821-428-979; 076-720-099-398-453; 079-745-775-899-748; 079-761-408-777-140; 084-822-586-068-037; 086-798-785-956-462; 087-254-306-965-128; 087-743-172-903-657; 092-771-553-591-123; 094-030-260-436-845; 094-271-051-870-271; 097-706-585-881-767; 101-155-878-781-414; 110-049-647-929-204; 113-494-558-853-871; 113-735-323-410-595; 123-677-823-268-329; 125-251-154-919-925; 139-278-023-868-708; 145-216-409-753-368; 146-781-886-451-555; 147-454-088-321-99X; 150-882-026-824-099; 154-288-916-097-042; 154-421-151-458-730; 155-198-925-865-784; 158-356-597-269-587; 164-645-252-787-723; 166-800-181-448-862; 168-382-074-943-247; 169-521-165-144-583; 171-662-151-280-77X; 172-353-478-976-653; 197-581-828-023-548; 197-730-346-723-45X,8

Kauzlarich,"Nanogermanium is a material that has great potential for technological applications, and doped and alloyed Ge nanocrystals (NCs) are actively being considered. New alloys and compositions are possible in colloidal synthesis because the reactions are kinetically rather than thermodynamically controlled. Most of the Group V elements have been shown to be n-type dopants in Ge to increase carrier concentration; however, thermodynamically, Bi shows no solubility in crystalline Ge. Bi-doped Ge NCs were synthesized for the first time in a microwave-assisted solution route. The oleylamine capping ligand can be replaced by dodecanethiol without loss of Bi. A positive correlation between the lattice parameter and the concentration of Bi content (0.5–2.0 mol %) is shown via powder X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning TEM, and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy are consistent with the Bi solubility up to ...",29,17.0,7353,7363,Lattice constant; Physical chemistry; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Inorganic chemistry; Dopant; Materials science; Selected area diffraction; Oleylamine; Interface and colloid science; Germanium; Doping,,,,"Division of Chemistry; Army Research Office; Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems; Division of Materials Research",https://ucdavis.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/bismuth-doping-of-germanium-nanocrystals-through-colloidal-chemis https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02241 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02241 https://pubsdc3.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02241,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02241,,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02241,2740570731.0,,0,001-262-079-537-368; 002-492-737-604-877; 003-133-079-788-310; 003-759-160-920-504; 003-963-879-970-965; 005-763-988-191-748; 006-425-808-824-806; 006-833-403-685-222; 007-632-629-755-794; 007-804-658-656-945; 008-351-130-021-877; 008-668-667-428-816; 009-671-624-722-920; 009-978-205-182-241; 010-316-822-588-987; 010-380-232-314-456; 011-590-617-107-521; 017-317-466-526-593; 018-134-396-156-359; 020-615-440-030-649; 023-844-960-071-944; 023-941-114-220-562; 024-576-722-682-123; 025-413-690-190-123; 025-539-684-125-580; 025-830-883-116-103; 026-344-449-565-187; 028-079-927-207-164; 028-286-637-652-464; 029-684-879-068-367; 030-438-236-515-460; 030-919-888-158-267; 031-587-399-638-962; 032-856-403-153-861; 032-865-674-498-399; 036-533-819-844-315; 038-705-606-912-127; 039-494-110-162-499; 042-709-698-895-805; 046-241-389-807-773; 047-026-869-025-214; 048-090-354-643-34X; 054-369-335-159-793; 056-415-343-695-681; 057-308-254-746-216; 059-464-399-490-458; 059-501-759-257-028; 062-111-340-282-931; 062-974-429-289-375; 063-315-965-933-985; 066-384-107-491-007; 066-597-662-637-422; 070-290-067-254-935; 070-407-419-814-50X; 077-364-162-169-812; 078-027-941-634-655; 080-662-503-953-319; 084-916-103-506-416; 085-207-143-194-810; 092-606-495-510-938; 095-348-089-417-148; 097-075-698-008-51X; 101-822-034-384-837; 103-713-735-616-637; 107-488-493-770-064; 107-592-503-537-822; 110-349-312-829-425; 110-784-645-760-629; 116-408-734-166-161; 125-464-394-154-916; 127-928-612-627-992; 132-433-049-156-154; 139-015-188-597-454; 141-434-831-970-069; 146-428-689-017-656; 147-718-432-447-863,21

Several by-products have been used as raw materials or fuels to reduce environmental impacts. Basaltic waste collected by filters was employed as a mineral mixture to Portland cement and two fractions were tested. The compression strength of mortars was measured after 7 days and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Diffraction Scattering (EDS) were carried out on Portland cement paste with the basaltic residue. Gains in compression strength were observed for mixtures containing 2.5 wt.% of basaltic residue. Hydration products observed on surface of basaltic particles show the nucleation effect of mineral mixtures.

While XRD verified the formation of single spinel phases with lattice parameters reduced by increasing Cr substitution, FTIR and XAS provided insight into the subsequently increased covalence of the chemical bonding of the spinels. The mixed transition-metal spinel oxides were employed as working electrodes in Li metal batteries. In agreement with the literature, the spinel oxides experience amorphization during the first discharge, as shown by ex situ XRD and selected area electron diffraction (SAED).

It has been confirmed that the Fe3O4 magnetite nanoparticles and (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) coated on the magnetite nanoparticles play important roles in the formation of Au nanoplates. Significantly, such Au nanoplates exhibit remarkable optical properties, both the dipole plasmon resonance and the quadrupole plasmon resonance were observed.

Scheinost,"To elucidate the potential risk of 126Sn migration from nuclear waste repositories, we investigated the surface reactions of SnII on goethite as a function of pH and SnII loading under anoxic condition with O2 level < 2 ppmv. Tin redox state and surface structure were investigated by Sn K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), goethite phase transformations were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. The results demonstrate the rapid and complete oxidation of SnII by goethite and formation of SnIV 1E and 2C surface complexes. The contribution of 2C complexes increases with Sn loading. The SnII oxidation leads to a quantitative release of FeII from goethite at low pH, and to the precipitation of magnetite at higher pH. To predict Sn sorption, we applied surface complexation modeling using the charge distribution multisite complexation approach and the XAS-derived surface complexes.

In the range of 1050 to 1150 °C, there exists a wide solid solution BaIn x Co 1  − x O y (0.1 ≤  x  ≤ 0.84, 2.54 ≤  y  ≤ 2.59) with the cubic perovskite structure. At 1050 °C, the cubic phase transforms to an orthorhombic phase firstly at x  = 0.55 and the cubic solid solution is separated into two regions, and narrowed with the decrease of the temperature. The structure of the cubic phase in In-rich region appears as a super-lattice ( a ′ ) of the simple cubic phase ( a p ) with the modulation vector a ′  = 2 a p . At 950 °C, a tetragonal phase BaIn 0.64 Co 0.36 O y emerges and extends to a solid solution at lower temperature. The orthorhombic and tetragonal structures are studied by electron diffraction and powder X-ray Rietveld analysis.

000-101-439-736-034,Formation of secondary phase at grain boundary of flash-sintered BaTiO3.,,2014,journal article,"Microscopy (Oxford, England)",20505701; 20505698,Japanese Society of Microscopy,Japan,Akinori Uehashi; Katsuhiro Sasaki; Tomoharu Tokunaga; Hidehiro Yoshida; Takahisa Yamamoto,"Recently, Raj et.al. have developed a very unique sintering technique, called flash-sintering [1]. According to their report, fully densified ZrO2-3mol%Y2O3 ceramic bulks were successfully obtained only at 800°C for 5sec. Considering the conventional sintering condition around 1500°C for a few hours necessary to obtain ZrO2-3mol%Y2O3 ceramic bulks, their sintering technique is very attracting from a viewpoint of sintering temperature, soaking time and further the physical phenomena. The flash-sintering is a technique that green compacts were heating under application of high electric field. When furnace temperature reaches at a critical temperature, the electric current abruptly increases and the compact sinters near full density with a very high shrinkage rate. So far, a few studies about flash-sintering were reported for Y2O3 [2], SrTiO3, MgO-Al2O3. To understand the detail mechanism of flash-sintering, more case studies must be necessary. In this study, we focused BaTiO3 widely used for electro-ceramics, which has not been investigated from a viewpoint of flash-sintering.Green compacts were prepared from BaTiO3 raw powders (0.1-m, 99.9%, SAKAI chemical industry Co. Ltd., Lot. No.1308607) after uniaxially pressed at 100MPa into a rectangular shape with 2x10x30mm(3). The green compacts were suspended into a box type furnace by Pt-wires with Pt-based paste. Then, the furnace temperature was raised at 300°C/h under application of electric field ranged from 25V/cm to 350V/cm with monitoring the specimen current. After sintering, the shrinkages, microstructure of the sintered compacts were investigated.Sintering rates at all electric fields were found to be accelerated by applying electric field in BaTiO3. The appearance of abrupt current increment was confirmed over the application of 75V/cm. For example, a density of green compact reached about 90% relative density of BaTiO3 only at 1020°C for 1min at 100V/cm. However, the final shrinkages were revealed to decrease with an increase in electric fields, which is very different from the case of ZrO2-3mol%Y2O3 and Y2O3 ceramics. This fact means that application of high electric fields does not effectively operate for enhancement of shrinkage rates in the case of BaTiO3. In contrast, only gradual current increment was observed at 25V/cm, which is categorized in field-assisted sintering (FAST) process. The density of the green compact at 25V/cm was more than 95%.To investigate the mechanism of the decrease in a total shrinkage with electric fields, the microstructure of flash-sintered compact was observed. As a result, it was found that discharge occurs during flash-sintering process, indicating that the input power due to high electric fields does not work effectively. A typical example of the microstructure near the discharge area is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 is a TEM bright field image taken from BaTiO3 flash-sintered at 100V/cm. As seen in the image, the formation of a secondary phase along the grain boundary can be clearly seen. Diffractometric and EDS analysis have revealed that the secondary phase is BaTi4O9, one of compounds between BaO and TiO2 system. By discharging, grain boundaries partially melt and a part of Ba vaporizes to form BaTi4O9 with cooling. To investigate flash-sintering behaviors, it was concluded that FAST process play an important role to enhance the shrinklage rate in the case of BaTiO3.jmicro;63/suppl_1/i19/DFU048F1F1DFU048F1Fig. 1.TEM bright field image of a secondary phase and the electron diffraction pattern taken from the secondary phase.",63 Suppl 1,,i19,i20,,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25359812,25359812.0,,,,0,,1
